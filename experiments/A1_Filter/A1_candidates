The education of a Sioux boy began before he was even born
" As Eastman later recalled, after a boy was born, his family and tribe wasted no time in continuing this natal initiation into the role of man :' Scarcely was the embyro warrior ushered into the world, when he was met by lullabies that speak of wonderful exploits in hunting and war . "
" During a Sioux boy' s younger years, he was largely raised by his mother . "
" As Eastman explains, the virtue of silence was part of a larger standard of' Indian etiquette' :' No one who is at all acquainted with the Indian in his home can deny that we are a polite people . "
" Indeed, the enforced intimacy of tent life would soon become intolerable, were it not for these instinctive reserves and delicacies, this unfailing respect for the established place and possessions of every other member of the family circle, this habitual quiet, order, and decorum' . "
" The love of a male Sioux did not revolve around a romantic sentimentality, but was rather shown through adherence to service and duty :' Every boy, from the very beginning of his training, is an embryo public servant . "
" The finest love a man could develop was for his fellow men; friendship was thought' to be the severest test of character' :' It is easy, we think, to be loyal to family and clan, whose blood is in our own veins . "
"' It was considered ridiculous to do so before attaining some honor as a warrior, and the novices prided themselves greatly upon their self - control' . "
" When a Sioux boy became a young man, his education was turned over to his father, or in Ohiyesa' s case, his uncle . "
" A boy was taught by the men in his tribe how to be a warrior and a hunter, and to understand the tribe' s code of honor . "
" A boy' s father would constantly ask him questions about natural phenomena, to see if he could identify certain plants, animal tracks, weather patterns, and so on . "
" It was a highly effective method of' schooling ,' as it strengthened a boy' s power of memorization, required him to exercise courage in facing the risk of public performance, sunk the tribe' s philosophy down into his marrow, and inspired him to live up to the heroes of the past :' Very early, the Indian boy assumed the task of preserving and transmitting the legends of his ancestors and his race . "

"
This sort of teaching at once enlightens the boy' s mind and stimulates his ambition.
" The fact that a Sioux boy was kept' ever before the public eye, from his birth onward' thus inspired him to perform well in his manly pursuits :' His entrance into the world, especially in the case of the first - born, was often publicly announced by the herald, accompanied by a distribution of presents to the old and needy . "
" The fact that honor goes only to those with skin the game was a lesson Ohiyesa learned well as a boy, when he asked his uncle for the claws of a bear he had hunted and killed :' We dragged the huge carcass within our lodge . "
" Eastman had to come to believe that his fellow Indians needed to adapt to the fast - encroaching ways of civilization, and thus strongly desired that his son become educated and learn the culture of the white man . "
" As Eastman unfolded to his son the wondrous inventions of civilization and the tenets of his new faith, Ohiyesa was filled with both' admiration and indignation' and had to fight down a voice within him which cried ,' A false life! "
He wished to educate the American people about Indian life as he had known it' the true ideals and ways of the Sioux' as he felt that the contact between the cultures needn' t be a one - way street; that whites had as much to learn from the native peoples as the natives had to learn from whites.
" In fact, as a boy he was rather sensitive, timid, and mild in disposition, and thought himself deficient in the military virtues . "

" If all of these external and' artificial' influences have molded our feelings, are they any more authentic than the other kinds of masks we wear? "

" Keep in mind that the masks of masculinity were typically not designed to suppress all emotions, all the time, but rather to enable a man to vent his emotions at a time of his choosing' one in which it would not be tactically disadvantageous or put his tribe in danger . "

" It wasn' t that you could never cry or be sad, you simply couldn' t afford to emotionally collapse on the battlefield, and so had to be able to turn off those feelings and be tough when the situation called for it . "
" Now that society is relatively peaceful and food and resources are easy to come by, does that mean that the masks of masculinity are obsolete and unnecessary' that they' re mismatched with our current reality and can thus be entirely thrown out? "
" If they do not, then people' again, no matter how egalitarian their views' are disgusted; remember the consternation over the man who fled the Aurora movie theater shooting, leaving his fianc' e and two small children behind? "
" In a period of grief, it is still a noble thing for a man to step up and act as the rock for his family . "
" The problem is not the masks men wear, but that in recent times, they haven' t been coupled with another: the mask of decorum, self - restraint, and civility . "
" Put another way, when men behave badly, the problem isn' t the masks created by the traditional code of manhood, but that the anemic state of the code in modern times has deprived these traditional masks from being molded with proper balance and nuance; the problem is not the existence of the masks themselves, but the way their shape has become distorted .
