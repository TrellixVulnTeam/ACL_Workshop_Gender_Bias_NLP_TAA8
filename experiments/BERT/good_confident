"Where the gravity of the crime and other factors--such as the age and education of the defendant,[860] the conduct of the court or the prosecuting officials,[861] and the complicated nature of the offense charged and the possible defenses thereto[862]--render criminal proceedings without counsel so apt to result in injustice as to be fundamentally unfair, the latter group [majority] holds that the accused must have legal assistance under the amendment whether he pleads guilty or elects to stand trial, whether he requests counsel or not."
"Wherever consideration was mentioned, it was always as quid pro quo, as what the contractor was to have for his contract."
"Wounds With Severe Bleeding A scout must be prepared to check severe bleeding at once, and he should then dress the wound."
Wrist Grip Of these the simplest is the one where the wrists of the swimmer have been grasped by the drowning man in his {283} struggles.
"YORK, PA., DEC. 24, 1852."
"(27) If a free man dies intestate, his movable goods are to be distributed by his next-of-kin and friends, under the supervision of the Church."
"(a) SERIOUS WOUNDS; (b) SERIOUS BLEEDING Send for the doctor at once, and then stop the bleeding and keep as clean as possible till he arrives."
"*       *       *       *       * The women of Oregon have raised a statue to this young explorer, and there she stands in Portland, facing the Coast, pointing to the Columbia River where it reaches the sea."
"* * * When a suspect speaks because he is overborne, it is immaterial whether he has been subjected to a physical or a mental ordeal."
"* * *[958] However, a conviction before a mayor's court does not become constitutionally defective by reason of the fact that the fixed salary of the mayor is paid out of the fund to which the fines imposed by him contribute."
"* All fines that have been given to us unjustly and against the law of the land, and all fines that we have exacted unjustly, shall be entirely remitted or the matter decided by a majority judgement of the twenty-five barons referred to below in the clause for securing the peace together with Stephen, archbishop of Canterbury, if he can be present, and such others as he wishes to bring with him."
; and every good citizen should lend his hand to help in every way possible the enforcement of law in each department.
[105] One such relationship is that of a stockholder and his corporation.
"[1058] But, as shown above, a naturalized citizen is subject at any time to have his good faith in taking the oath of allegiance to the United States inquired into, and to lose his citizenship if lack of such faith is shown in proper proceedings."
"[1059] Also, a person who has become a national by naturalization may lose his nationality by having a continuous residence for three years in the territory of a foreign state of which he was formerly a national or in which the place of his birth is situated, or by having a continuous residence for five years in any other foreign state or states."
[1094] An owner aggrieved by discrimination is entitled to have his assessment reduced to the common level.
"[1103] When State action is attacked under the due process clause, the assailant usually charges also that he is denied the equal protection of the laws."
"[1109] A State law governing fraudulent transfers was found to be compatible with the act of Congress,[1110] as was a statute which provided that a discharge in bankruptcy should be unavailing to terminate the suspension of the driver's license of a person who failed to pay a judgment rendered against him for damages resulting from his negligent operation of a motor vehicle."
[1133] A statute providing that no person shall be denied opportunity for employment because he is not a member of a union does not offend the equal protection clause.
"[115] Pardons and Reprieves THE LEGAL NATURE OF A PARDON In the first case to be decided concerning the pardoning power, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court, said: As this power had been exercised from time immemorial by the executive of that nation whose language is our language, and to whose judicial institutions ours bear a close resemblance; we adopt their principles respecting the operation and effect of a pardon, and look into their books for the rules prescribing the manner in which it is to be used by the person who would avail himself of it."
"[116] However, a person cannot be deprived of his liberty under a vague statute which subjected to fine or imprisonment, as a gangster, any one not engaged in any lawful occupation, known to be a member of a gang consisting of two or more persons, and who had been convicted of a crime in any State in the Union."
"[117] Liberties Pertaining to Education (of Teachers, Parents, Pupils).--A State law forbidding the teaching in any private denominational, parochial, or public school, of any modern language, other than English, to any child who has not successfully passed the eighth grade was declared, in Meyer _v._ Nebraska[118] to be an unconstitutional interference with the right of a foreign language teacher to teach and of parents to engage him so to instruct their children."
"[1206] An accused does not, however, have a legal right to a jury composed in whole or in part of members of his own race."
"[1240] Since the possession of government insurance payable to the person of his choice, is calculated to enhance the morale of the serviceman, Congress may permit him to designate any beneficiary he desires, irrespective of State law, and may exempt the proceeds from the claims of creditors."
"[127] By close divisions, it also sustained the right of a State to forbid the conscription of neutrals by the picketing of a restaurant solely because the owner had contracted for the erection of a building (not connected with the restaurant and located some distance away) by a contractor who employed nonunion men;[128] or the picketing of a shop operated by the owner without employees to induce him to observe certain closing hours."
"[13] THE WALL OF SEPARATION DOCTRINE In 1802 President Jefferson wrote a letter to a group of Baptists in Danbury, Connecticut in which he declared that it was the purpose of the First Amendment to build a wall of separation between Church and State,[14] and in Reynolds _v._ United States,[15] the first Anti-Mormon Case, Chief Justice Waite, speaking for the unanimous Court, characterized this as almost an authoritative declaration of the scope and effect of the amendment, one which left Congress free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order."
"[130] In exercising the power granted by section 5 to judge the qualifications of its own members, each House has asserted the power to inquire into the conduct of a member-elect prior to his election."
"[140] In contrast with the decision in United States _v._ Ju Toy[141] that a person seeking entrance to the United States was not entitled to a judicial hearing on his claim of citizenship, a person arrested and held for deportation is entitled to a day in court if he denies that he is an alien."
"[1437] While the Supreme Court conceded at an early date that the authority of the federal courts to entertain petitions for _habeas corpus_ derived solely from acts of Congress,[1438] a narrow majority recently asserted the right to expand the scope of the writ by judicial interpretation and to sanction its use for a purpose unknown to the common law, i.e., to bring a prisoner into court to argue his own appeal."
"[144] * * * These decisions have established the propositions that the rules of law concerning the employer's responsibility for personal injury or death of an employee arising in the course of employment are not beyond alteration by legislation in the public interest; that no person has a vested right entitling him to have these any more than other rules of law remain unchanged for his benefit; and that, if we exclude arbitrary and unreasonable changes, liability may be imposed upon the employer without fault, and the rules respecting his responsibility to one employee for the negligence of another and respecting contributory negligence and assumption of risk are subject to legislative change."
[16] An employee of the Post Office Department is not required to submit to examination by State authorities concerning his competence and to pay a license fee before performing his official duty in driving a motor truck for transporting the mail.
"[160] The right of a State to the fisheries within its borders he then held to be in the nature of a property right, held by the State for the use of the citizens thereof; the State was under no obligation to grant co-tenancy in the common property of the State, to the citizens of all the other States."
[1618] The Dartmouth College Case The third view is the one formulated by Chief Justice Marshall in his controlling opinion in Trustees of Dartmouth College _v._ Woodward.
"[1739] When the importer has so acted upon the thing imported, wrote Chief Justice Marshall, that it has become incorporated and mixed up with the mass of property in the country, it has, perhaps, lost its distinctive character as an import, and has become subject to the taxing power of the State; but while remaining the property of the importer, in his warehouse, in the original form or package in which it was imported, a tax upon it is too plainly a duty on imports, to escape the prohibition in the Constitution."
"[176] The constitutional requirement is satisfied if the nonresident is given access to the courts of the State upon terms which, in themselves, are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may have, even though they may not be technically the same as those accorded to resident citizens."
"[185] Justice McReynolds, speaking for the dissenting Justices, labelled the controls imposed by the challenged statute as a fanciful scheme to protect the farmer against undue exactions by prescribing the price at which milk disposed of by him at will may be resold."
"[2] At the command _Front,_ given when the ranks are aligned, each Scout turns her head and eyes to the front and drops the hand at her side."
"[20] Justice Frankfurter presented a concurring opinion for himself and Justices Jackson, Rutledge and Burton."
"[200] A person indicted a second time for the same offense is nonetheless a fugitive from justice by reason of the fact that after dismissal of the first indictment, on which he was originally indicted, he left the State with the knowledge of, or without objection by, State authorities."
[201] But a defendant cannot be extradited if he was only constructively present in the demanding State at the time of the commission of the crime charged.
[204] PROCEDURE FOR REMOVAL Only after a person has been charged with crime in the regular course of judicial proceedings is the governor of a State entitled to make demand for his return from another State.
"[209] A defendant will, however, be discharged on _habeas corpus_ if he shows by clear and satisfactory evidence that he was outside the demanding State at the time of the crime."
"[212] Similarly, measures authorizing the President to reorganize executive agencies have provided that a Reorganization Plan promulgated by him should be reported by Congress and should not become effective if one[213] or both[214] Houses adopted a resolution disapproving it."
"[22] When a person is charged with more than one crime, the right to a speedy trial does not require that he be first tried on the earliest indictment; no constitutional right is violated by removing him to another jurisdiction for trial on a later indictment."
[229] It is very true that in modern times many of the effects of either relation--master and servant or principal and agent--may be accounted for as the result of acts done by the master himself.
"[250] The case arose on indictments under section 6 of the so-called Enforcement Act of May 30, 1870,[251] which read as follows: That if two or more persons shall band or conspire together, or go in disguise upon the public highway, or upon the premises of another, with intent to violate any provision of this act, or to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any citizen, with intent to prevent or hinder his free exercise and enjoyment of any right or privilege granted or secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having exercised the same, such persons shall be held guilty of felony, etc."
"[280] In an advisory opinion which it rendered for President Monroe at his request on the power of Congress to appropriate funds for public improvements, the Court answered that such appropriations might be properly made under the war and postal powers."
[309] COMMERCE TODAY Later in his opinion Marshall qualified the word intercourse with the word commercial.
[311] The holding in the Myers case boils down to the proposition that the Constitution endows the President with an illimitable power to remove all officers in whose appointment he has participated with the exception of judges of the United States.
"[312] The reticence of the Constitution respecting removal left room for four possibilities, _first_, the one suggested by the common law doctrine of estate in office, from which the conclusion followed that the impeachment power was the only power of removal intended by the Constitution; _second_, that the power of removal was an incident of the power of appointment and hence belonged, at any rate in the absence of legal or other provision to the contrary, to the appointing authority; _third_, that Congress could, by virtue of its power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper, etc., determine the location of the removal of power; _fourth_, that the President by virtue of his executive power and his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, possesses the power of removal over all officers of the United States except judges."
"[324] Where property of a citizen has been mistakenly seized by the Government, converted into money and invested, the owner is entitled, in recovering compensation, to an allowance for the use of his property."
"[328] For the same reason, a State may not prevent a citizen from concluding with a foreign life insurance company at its home office a policy loan agreement whereby the policy of his life is pledged as collateral security for a cash loan to become due upon default in payment of premiums, in which case the entire policy reserve might be applied to discharge the indebtedness."
"[33] Even an individual cannot refuse to produce records which are in his custody on the plea that they might incriminate the owner or himself where the documents belong to a corporation,[34] or to a labor union."
"[34] Where a person is convicted of a crime which includes several incidents, a second trial for one of those incidents puts him twice in jeopardy."
"[34] Where a United States Senator was indicted for agreeing to receive compensation for services to be rendered in a proceeding before a government department, and it appeared that a tentative arrangement for such services was made in Illinois and confirmed in St. Louis, the defendant was properly tried in St. Louis, although he was not physically present in Missouri when notice of ratification was dispatched."
"[344] JEFFERSON'S REAL POSITION Nor did Jefferson himself officially support Madison's point of view, as the following extract from his minutes of a Conversation, which took place July 10, 1793, between himself and Citizen Genet, show: He asked if they [Congress] were not the sovereign."
[349] Said Senator Nelson of Minnesota: The President has asked us to give him the right to make war to expel the Spaniards from Cuba.
[352] CONGRESSIONAL IMPLEMENTATION OF PRESIDENTIAL POLICIES No President was ever more jealous of his prerogative in the realm of foreign relations than President Woodrow Wilson.
"[362] To recur to the case of rights acquired by prescription, every universal successor could add the time of his predecessor's adverse use to his own in order to make out the right."
[369] Water A statute making it unlawful for a riparian owner to divert water into another State does not deprive him of property without due process of law.
"[389] It is obvious that the foregoing reasoning leads to the conclusion that a disseisor of the tenant would be bound as much as the tenant himself, and this conclusion was adopted by the early law."
"[390] In short, the President's removal power, in this case unqualified, was the sanction provided by the Constitution for his power and duty to control his subordinates in all their official actions of public consequence."
"[418] And to implement such prohibition, a State has the power to declare that places where liquor is manufactured or kept shall be deemed common nuisances;[419] and even to subject an innocent owner to the forfeiture of his property for the acts of a wrongdoer."
"[42] As a means of enforcing a valid statute, the Government may require any person subject thereto to keep a record showing whether he has in fact complied with it,[43] and to submit that record to inspection by government officers."
"[436] Conversely, when President Wilson failed in March 1917 to obtain Congress's consent to his arming American merchant vessels with defensive arms, he went ahead and did it anyway, fortified not only by the known sentiments of the majority in Congress but also by the advice of his Secretary of State and Attorney General."
"[445] The doctrine dictated by the above considerations as regards the exercise of executive power in the field of legislative power was well stated by Mr John W. Davis, principal counsel on the present occasion for the steel companies, in a brief which he filed nearly forty years ago as Solicitor General, in defense of the action of the President in withdrawing certain lands from public entry although his doing so was at the time contrary to express statute."
"[45] SERVICE ON OUT-OF-STATE OWNERS OF MOTOR VEHICLES By analogy to the above cases, it has been held that a State may require nonresident owners of motor vehicles to designate an official within the State as an agent upon whom process may be served in any legal proceedings growing out of their operation of a motor vehicle within the State;[46] and while these cases arose under the Fourteenth Amendment alone, unquestionably a judgment validly obtained upon this species of service could be enforced upon the owner of a car through the courts of his home State."
"[493] In his dictum in Cohens _v._ Virginia, Chief Justice Marshall also indicated that perhaps no jurisdiction existed over suits by States to enforce their penal laws."
"[5] And in Hampton _v._ McConnell[6] some years later, Chief Justice Marshall went even further, using language which seems to show that he regarded the judgment of a State court as constitutionally entitled to be accorded in the courts of sister States not simply the faith and credit of conclusive evidence, but the validity of a final judgment."
"[52] The clause does not impair the obligation of a witness to testify if a prosecution against him is barred by lapse of time, by statutory enactment, or by a pardon;[53] but the effect of a mere tender of pardon by the President remains uncertain."
"[53] In his book, _Our Chief Magistrate and his Powers_, Ex-President Taft warmly protested against the notion that the President has any constitutional warrant to attempt the role of a Universal Providence."
"[54] A decade earlier his destined successor, Woodrow Wilson, had avowed the opinion that the President is at liberty, both in law and conscience, to be as big a man as he can."
[54] A witness may not refuse to answer questions on the ground that he would thereby expose himself to prosecution by a state.
"[542] In Baltimore and Ohio R. Co. _v._ Baugh,[543] which further projected the Tyson rule into the law of torts in disregard of State law, Justice Field wrote a sharp dissent in which he indicated an opinion that the Supreme Court's disregard of State court decisions was unconstitutional."
"[55] Conversely, the admission against a defendant in a federal court of testimony given by him in a state court under a statute of immunity is valid."
"[552] Justice Butler, joined by Justice McReynolds, concurred in the result, because in his view Tompkins was not entitled to damages under general law, but he deprecated the reversal of Swift _v._ Tyson."
"[56] If an accused takes the stand in his own behalf, he must submit to cross-examination;[57] while if he does not, it is by no means certain that the trial judge in a federal court may not, without violation of the clause, draw the jury's attention to the fact."
"[579] But when a resident policyholder's loan is merely charged against the reserve value of his policy, under an arrangement for extinguishing the debt and interest thereon by deduction from any claim under the policy, such credit is not taxable to the foreign insurance company."
[61] An individual who has acquired income by illicit means is not excused from making out an income tax return because he might thereby expose himself to a criminal prosecution by the United States.
"[64] Deploring such attempts, nullified consistently in the preceding cases, to convert the due process clause into a substantive restraint on the powers of the States, Justice Miller in Davidson _v._ New Orleans[65] obliquely counseled against a departure from the conventional application of the clause, albeit he acknowledged the difficulty of arriving at a precise, all inclusive, definition thereof."
[65] A bankrupt is not deprived of his constitutional right not to testify against himself by an order requiring him to surrender his books to a duly authorized receiver.
"[652] Unless, by its rulings of law, the State court prevented a complainant from obtaining substantially any compensation, its findings as to the amount of damages will not be overturned on appeal, even though as a consequence of error therein the property owner received less than he ought."
"[670] (2) Hearing.--The necessity and expediency of a taking being legislative questions irrespective of who may be charged with their decision, a hearing thereon need not be afforded;[671] but the mode of determining the compensation payable to an owner must be such as to furnish him with an opportunity to be heard."
"[68] 334 U.S. 378 (1948).--In a dissenting opinion filed in the case of Sherrer _v._ Sherrer, but applicable also to the case of Coe _v._ Coe, Justice Frankfurter, with Justice Murphy concurring, asserted his inability to accept the proposition advanced by the majority that regardless of how overwhelming the evidence may have been that the asserted domicile in the State offering bargain-counter divorces was a sham, the home State of the parties is not permitted to question the matter if the form of a controversy had been gone through."
"[695] Similarly, in a suit against a local partnership, in which the resident partner was duly served with process and the nonresident partner was served only with notice, a judgment thus obtained is binding upon the firm and the resident partner, but is not a personal judgment against the nonresident and cannot be enforced by execution against his individual property."
"[696] That the nonresident partner should have been so protected is attributable to the fact the process of a court of one State cannot run into another and summon a party there domiciled to respond to proceedings against him, when neither his person nor his property is within the jurisdiction of the Court rendering the judgment."
"[697] In the case of a resident, however, absence alone will not defeat the processes of courts in the State of his domicile; for domicile is deemed to be sufficient to keep him within reach of the State courts for purposes of a personal judgment, whether obtained by means of appropriate, substituted service, or by actual personal service on the resident at a point outside the State."
[728] The Burr Trial Not long afterward the Chief Justice went to Richmond to preside over the trial of Burr himself.
"[732] The Court in a five-to-four opinion by Justice Jackson in effect took the former view holding that the two-witness principle interdicted imputation of _incriminating acts_ to the accused by circumstantial evidence or by the testimony of a single witness,[733] even though the single witness in question was the accused himself."
"[735] Here it was held that although the overt acts relied upon to support the charge of treason--defendant's harboring and sheltering in his home his son who was an enemy spy and saboteur, assisting him in purchasing an automobile, and in obtaining employment in a defense plant--were all acts which a father would naturally perform for a son, this fact did not necessarily relieve them of the treasonable purpose of giving aid and comfort to the enemy."
"[764] Pleas in Abatement.--State legislation which forbids a defendant to come into court and challenge the validity of service upon him in a personal action without thereby surrendering himself to the jurisdiction of the Court, but which does not restrain him from protecting his substantive rights against enforcement of a judgment rendered without service of process, is constitutional and does not deprive him of property without due process of law."
"[817] For want of adequate enjoyment of the right to counsel, the Court, in Powell _v._ Alabama,[818] overturned the conviction of Negroes who had received sentences of death for rape, and asserted that, at least in capital cases, where the defendant is unable to employ counsel and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance, illiteracy, or the like, it is the duty of the court, whether requested or not, to assign counsel for him as a necessary requisite of due process of Law."
"[883] Procuring a conviction for a capital crime by use of a confession extracted by protracted interrogation conducted in a similar manner was, on the authority of Chambers _v._ Florida, condemned in White _v._ Texas;[884] and in Lisenba _v._ California,[885] a case rendered inconclusive by conflicting testimony, the Court remarked, by way of dictum, that the concept of due process would void a trial in which, by threats or promises in the presence of court and jury, a defendant was induced to testify against himself, or in which a confession is used which is procured * * * by fraud, collusion, trickery and subornation or perjury."
"[888] Justice Jackson protested that interrogation _per se_ is not, * * *, an outlaw; and that inasmuch as all questioning is 'inherently coercive' * * *, the ultimate question * * * [must be] whether the confessor was in possession of his own will and self-control at the time of [his] confession."
"[89] In part, Justice Holmes's criticism of his colleagues was unfair, for his rational and fair man could not function in a vacuum, and, in appraising the constitutionality of State legislation, could no more avoid being guided by his preferences or economic predilections than were the Justices constituting the majority."
"[900] In a concurring opinion concerning the scope of the protection afforded by this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Justice Frankfurter contended that further argument thereon is foreclosed by Twining _v._ New Jersey, a precedent, on which he commented as follows: Decisions of this Court do not have equal intrinsic authority."
"[926] Such language appears to effect the very absorption into the Fourteenth Amendment which Justice Frankfurter rejects in the Adamson case; but he concluded by adding that as long as a State [does not] affirmatively * * * sanction * * * [arbitrary] police incursion into privacy; that is, as long as its police are deterred from making searches without authority of law by virtue of such internal discipline as an alert public opinion may induce and by reason of the statutory or common law remedies which the victims of such illegal searches may invoke, a State, without running counter to the due process clause, may employ at a trial incriminating evidence obtained by unlawful search and seizure."
"[96] THE PRESIDENT AS COMMANDER OF THE FORCES While the President customarily delegates supreme command of the forces in active service, there is no constitutional reason why he should do so; and he has been known to resolve personally important questions of military policy."
"[967] On the other hand, a prisoner who, after having been indicted on a charge of receiving stolen goods, abides by the prosecutor's suggestion and pleads guilty to the lesser offense of attempted second degree grand larceny, cannot later contend that a judgment of guilty of the latter offense was lacking in due process in that it amounted to a conviction of a crime for which he had never been indicted."
_But she must remember to obey first and complain afterward._ =VIII.
"_Carelessness at Home._ As for example, starting the fire with kerosene; leaving gas jets burning where curtains of clothing may be blown into the flame; leaving clothing or paper too near a fire; throwing matches you thought had been put out into paper or other material which will catch fire easily; leaving oily or greasy rags where they will easily overheat or take fire spontaneously; leaving objects on stairs and in hallways which will cause others to fall; leaving scalding water where a child may fall into it or pull it down, spilling the scalding water over himself; leaving rags or linoleum with upturned edges for someone to fall over; and innumerable other careless things which will occur to you."
