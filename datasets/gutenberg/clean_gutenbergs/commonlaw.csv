9,Italics and diacritical marks such as accents and cedillas are omitted and unmarked.
10,Lecture X has two subheads Successions After Death and Successions Inter Vivos.
11,Lecture XI is also titled Successions Inter Vivos.
12,The object of this book is to present a general view of the Common Law.
13,"To accomplish the task, other tools are needed besides logic."
14,"It is something to show that the consistency of a system requires a particular result, but it is not all."
15,The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.
16,"The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow men, have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed."
17,"The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics."
18,"In order to know what it is, we must know what it has been, and what it tends to become."
19,We must alternately consult history and existing theories of legislation.
20,But the most difficult labor will be to understand the combination of the two into new products at every stage.
21,"The substance of the law at any given time pretty nearly corresponds, so far as it goes, with what is then understood to be convenient; but its form and machinery, and the degree to which it is able to work out desired results, depend very much upon its past."
22,"In Massachusetts today, while, on the one hand, there are a great many rules which are quite sufficiently accounted for by their manifest good sense, on the other, there are some which can only be understood by reference to the infancy of procedure among the German tribes, or to the social condition of Rome under the Decemvirs."
23,"I shall use the history of our law so far as it is necessary to explain a conception or to interpret a rule, but no further."
24,In doing so there are two errors equally to be avoided both by writer and reader.
25,"One is that of supposing, because an idea seems very familiar and natural to us, that it has always been so."
26,Many things which we take for granted have had to be laboriously fought out or thought out in past times.
27,The other mistake is the opposite one of asking too much of history.
28,We start with man full grown.
29,"It may be assumed that the earliest barbarian whose practices are to be considered, had a good many of the same feelings and passions as ourselves."
30,The first subject to be discussed is the general theory of liability civil and criminal.
31,"The Common Law has changed a good deal since the beginning of our series of reports, and the search after a theory which may now be said to prevail is very much a study of tendencies."
32,"I believe that it will be instructive to go back to the early forms of liability, and to start from them."
33,It is commonly known that the early forms of legal procedure were grounded in vengeance.
34,"Modern writers have thought that the Roman law started from the blood feud, and all the authorities agree that the German law begun in that way."
35,"The feud led to the composition, at first optional, then compulsory, by which the feud was bought off."
36,"The gradual encroachment of the composition may be traced in the Anglo Saxon laws, / and the feud was pretty well broken up, though not extinguished, by the time of William the Conqueror."
37,The killings and house burnings of an earlier day became the appeals of mayhem and arson.
38,"The appeals de pace et plagis and of mayhem became, or rather were in substance, the action of trespass which is still familiar to lawyers."
39,"/ But as the compensation recovered in the appeal was the alternative of vengeance, we might expect to find its scope limited to the scope of vengeance."
40,"Vengeance imports a feeling of blame, and an opinion, however distorted by passion, that a wrong has been done."
41,It can hardly go very far beyond the case of a harm intentionally inflicted: even a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked.
42,"Whether for this cause or another, the early English appeals for personal violence seem to have been confined to intentional wrongs."
43,"Glanvill / mentions melees, blows, and wounds, all forms of intentional violence."
44,In the fuller description of such appeals given by Bracton / it is made quite clear that they were based on intentional assaults.
45,"The appeal de pace et plagis laid an intentional assault, described the nature of the arms used, and the length and depth of the wound."
46,The appellor also had to show that he immediately raised the hue and cry.
47,"So when Bracton speaks of the lesser offences, which were not sued by way of appeal, he instances only intentional wrongs, such as blows with the fist, flogging, wounding, insults, and so forth."
48,/ The cause of action in the cases of trespass reported in the earlier Year Books and in the Abbreviatio Plaeitorum is always an intentional wrong.
49,"It was only at a later day, and after argument, that trespass was extended so as to embrace harms which were foreseen, but which were not the intended consequence of the defendant's act."
50,/ Thence again it extended to unforeseen injuries.
51,"/ It will be seen that this order of development is not quite consistent with an opinion which has been held, that it was a characteristic of early law not to penetrate beyond the external visible fact, the damnum corpore corpori datum."
52,"It has been thought that an inquiry into the internal condition of the defendant, his culpability or innocence, implies a refinement of juridical conception equally foreign to Rome before the Lex Aquilia, and to England when trespass took its shape."
53,I do not know any very satisfactory evidence that a man was generally held liable either in Rome / or England for the accidental consequences even of his own act.
54,"But whatever may have been the early law, the foregoing account shows the starting point of the system with which we have to deal."
55,"Our system of private liability for the consequences of a man's own acts, that is, for his trespasses, started from the notion of actual intent and actual personal culpability."
56,"The original principles of liability for harm inflicted by another person or thing have been less carefully considered hitherto than those which governed trespass, and I shall therefore devote the rest of this Lecture to discussing them."
57,"I shall try to show that this liability also had its root in the passion of revenge, and to point out the changes by which it reached its present form."
58,"But I shall not confine myself strictly to what is needful for that purpose, because it is not only most interesting to trace the transformation throughout its whole extent, but the story will also afford an instructive example of the mode in which the law has grown, without a break, from barbarism to civilization."
59,"Furthermore, it will throw much light upon some important and peculiar doctrines which cannot be returned to later."
60,"A very common phenomenon, and one very familiar to the student of history, is this."
61,"The customs, beliefs, or needs of a primitive time establish a rule or a formula."
62,"In the course of centuries the custom, belief, or necessity disappears, but the rule remains."
63,"The reason which gave rise to the rule has been forgotten, and ingenious minds set themselves to inquire how it is to be accounted for."
64,"Some ground of policy is thought of, which seems to explain it and to reconcile it with the present state of things; and then the rule adapts itself to the new reasons which have been found for it, and enters on a new career."
65,"The old form receives a new content, and in time even the form modifies itself to fit the meaning which it has received."
66,The subject under consideration illustrates this course of events very clearly.
67,"I will begin by taking a medley of examples embodying as many distinct rules, each with its plausible and seemingly sufficient ground of policy to explain it."
68,"A man has an animal of known ferocious habits, which escapes and does his neighbor damage."
69,"He can prove that the animal escaped through no negligence of his, but still he is held liable."
70,"It is, says the analytical jurist, because, although he was not negligent at the moment of escape, he was guilty of remote heedlessness, or negligence, or fault, in having such a creature at all."
71,And one by whose fault damage is done ought to pay for it.
72,"A baker's man, while driving his master's cart to deliver hot rolls of a morning, runs another man down."
73,The master has to pay for it.
74,"And when he has asked why he should have to pay for the wrongful act of an independent and responsible being, he has been answered from the time of Ulpian to that of Austin, that it is because he was to blame for employing an improper person."
75,"If he answers, that he used the greatest possible care in choosing his driver, he is told that that is no excuse; and then perhaps the reason is shifted, and it is said that there ought to be a remedy against some one who can pay the damages, or that such wrongful acts as by ordinary human laws are likely to happen in the course of the service are imputable to the service."
76,"Next, take a case where a limit has been set to liability which had previously been unlimited."
77,"In Congress passed a law, which is still in force, and by which the owners of ships in all the more common cases of maritime loss can surrender the vessel and her freight then pending to the losers; and it is provided that, thereupon, further proceedings against the owners shall cease."
78,"The legislators to whom we owe this act argued that, if a merchant embark a portion of his property upon a hazardous venture, it is reasonable that his stake should be confined to what he puts at risk, a principle similar to that on which corporations have been so largely created in America during the last fifty years."
79,"It has been a rule of criminal pleading in England down into the present century, that an indictment for homicide must set forth the value of the instrument causing the death, in order that the king or his grantee might claim forfeiture of the deodand, as an accursed thing, in the language of Blackstone."
80,"I might go on multiplying examples; but these are enough to show the remoteness of the points to be brought together. As a first step towards a generalization, it will be necessary to consider what is to be found in ancient and independent systems of law."
81,"There is a well known passage in Exodus, / which we shall have to remember later: If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit."
82,"When we turn from the Jews to the Greeks, we find the principle of the passage just quoted erected into a system."
83,"Plutarch, in his Solon, tells us that a dog that had bitten a man was to be delivered up bound to a log four cubits long."
84,Plato made elaborate provisions in his Laws for many such cases.
85,"If a slave killed a man, he was to be given up to the relatives of the deceased."
86,"/ If he wounded a man, he was to be given up to the injured party to use him as he pleased."
87,/ So if he did damage to which the injured party did not contribute as a joint cause.
88,"In either case, if the owner failed to surrender the slave, he was bound to make good the loss."
89,"/ If a beast killed a man, it was to be slain and cast beyond the borders."
90,"If an inanimate thing caused death, it was to be cast beyond the borders in like manner, and expiation was to be made."
91,"/ Nor was all this an ideal creation of merely imagined law, for it was said in one of the speeches of Aeschines, that we banish beyond our borders stocks and stones and steel, voiceless and mindless things, if they chance to kill a man; and if a man commits suicide, bury the hand that struck the blow afar from its body."
92,"This is mentioned quite as an every day matter, evidently without thinking it at all extraordinary, only to point an antithesis to the honors heaped upon Demosthenes."
93,/ As late as the second century after Christ the traveller Pausanias observed with some surprise that they still sat in judgment on inanimate things in the Prytaneum.
94,/ Plutarch attributes the institution to Draco.
95,/ In the Roman law we find the similar principles of the noxoe deditio gradually leading to further results.
96,"provided that, if an animal had done damage, either the animal was to be surrendered or the damage paid for."
97,"/ We learn from Gains that the same rule was applied to the torts of children or slaves, / and there is some trace of it with regard to inanimate things."
98,"The Roman lawyers, not looking beyond their own system or their own time, drew on their wits for an explanation which would show that the law as they found it was reasonable."
99,"Gaius said that it was unjust that the fault of children or slaves should be a source of loss to their parents or owners beyond their own bodies, and Ulpian reasoned that a fortiori this was true of things devoid of life, and therefore incapable of fault."
100,"/ This way of approaching the question seems to deal with the right of surrender as if it were a limitation of a liability incurred by a parent or owner, which would naturally and in the first instance be unlimited."
101,"But if that is what was meant, it puts the cart before the horse."
102,"The right of surrender was not introduced as a limitation of liability, but, in Rome and Greece alike, payment was introduced as the alternative of a failure to surrender."
103,"The action was not based, as it would be nowadays, on the fault of the parent or owner."
104,"If it had been, it would always have been brought against the person who had control of the slave or animal at the time it did the harm complained of, and who, if any one, was to blame for not preventing the injury."
105,"So far from this being the course, the person to be sued was the owner at the time of suing."
106,The action followed the guilty thing into whosesoever hands it came.
107,"/ And in curious contrast with the principle as inverted to meet still more modern views of public policy, if the animal was of a wild nature, that is, in the very case of the most ferocious animals, the owner ceased to be liable the moment it escaped, because at that moment he ceased to be owner."
108,"/ There seems to have been no other or more extensive liability by the old law, even where a slave was guilty with his master's knowledge, unless perhaps he was a mere tool in his master's hands."
109,"/ Gains and Ulpian showed an inclination to cut the noxoe deditio down to a privilege of the owner in case of misdeeds committed without his knowledge; but Ulpian is obliged to admit, that by the ancient law, according to Celsus, the action was noxal where a slave was guilty even with the privity of his master."
110,/ All this shows very clearly that the liability of the owner was merely a way of getting at the slave or animal which was the immediate cause of offence.
111,"In other words, vengeance on the immediate offender was the object of the Greek and early Roman process, not indemnity from the master or owner."
112,The liability of the owner was simply a liability of the offending thing.
113,"In the primitive customs of Greece it was enforced by a judicial process expressly directed against the object, animate or inanimate."
114,"The Roman Twelve Tables made the owner, instead of the thing itself, the defendant, but did not in any way change the ground of liability, or affect its limit."
115,The change was simply a device to allow the owner to protect his interest.
116,"/ But it may be asked how inanimate objects came to be pursued in this way, if the object of the procedure was to gratify the passion of revenge."
117,"Learned men have been ready to find a reason in the personification of inanimate nature common to savages and children, and there is much to confirm this view."
118,"Without such a personification, anger towards lifeless things would have been transitory, at most."
119,"It is noticeable that the commonest example in the most primitive customs and laws is that of a tree which falls upon a man, or from which he falls and is killed."
120,We can conceive with comparative ease how a tree might have been put on the same footing with animals.
121,"It certainly was treated like them, and was delivered to the relatives, or chopped to pieces for the gratification of a real or simulated passion."
122,"/ In the Athenian process there is also, no doubt, to be traced a different thought."
123,"Expiation is one of the ends most insisted on by Plato, and appears to have been the purpose of the procedure mentioned by Aeschines."
124,Some passages in the Roman historians which will be mentioned again seem to point in the same direction.
125,"/ Another peculiarity to be noticed is, that the liability seems to have been regarded as attached to the body doing the damage, in an almost physical sense."
126,An untrained intelligence only imperfectly performs the analysis by which jurists carry responsibility back to the beginning of a chain of causation.
127,"The hatred for anything giving us pain, which wreaks itself on the manifest cause, and which leads even civilized man to kick a door when it pinches his finger, is embodied in the noxoe deditio and other kindred doctrines of early Roman law."
128,"There is a defective passage in Gaius, which seems to say that liability may sometimes be escaped by giving up even the dead body of the offender."
129,"/ So Livy relates that, Brutulus Papins having caused a breach of truce with the Romans, the Samnites determined to surrender him, and that, upon his avoiding disgrace and punishment by suicide, they sent his lifeless body."
130,"It is noticeable that the surrender seems to be regarded as the natural expiation for the breach of treaty, / and that it is equally a matter of course to send the body when the wrong doer has perished."
131,/ The most curious examples of this sort occur in the region of what we should now call contract.
132,"Livy again furnishes an example, if, indeed, the last is not one."
133,"The Roman Consul Postumius concluded the disgraceful peace of the Caudine Forks , and he was sent to Rome to obtain the sanction of the people."
134,"When there however, he proposed that the persons who had made the contract, including himself, should be given up in satisfaction of it."
135,"For, he said, the Roman people not having sanctioned the agreement, who is so ignorant of the jus fetialium as not to know that they are released from obligation by surrendering us"
136,The formula of surrender seems to bring the case within the noxoe deditio.
137,"/ Cicero narrates a similar surrender of Mancinus by the pater patratus to the Numantines, who, however, like the Samnites in the former case, refused to receive him."
138,/ It might be asked what analogy could have been found between a breach of contract and those wrongs which excite the desire for vengeance.
139,"But it must be remembered that the distinction between tort and breaches of contract, and especially between the remedies for the two, is not found ready made."
140,It is conceivable that a procedure adapted to redress for violence was extended to other cases as they arose.
141,"Slaves were surrendered for theft as well as for assault; / and it is said that a debtor who did not pay his debts, or a seller who failed to deliver an article for which he had been paid, was dealt with on the same footing as a thief."
142,"/ This line of thought, together with the quasi material conception of legal obligations as binding the offending body, which has been noticed, would perhaps explain the well known law of the Twelve Tables as to insolvent debtors."
143,"According to that law, if a man was indebted to several creditors and insolvent, after certain formalities they might cut up his body and divide it among them."
144,"If there was a single creditor, he might put his debtor to death or sell him as a slave."
145,"/ If no other right were given but to reduce a debtor to slavery, the law might be taken to look only to compensation, and to be modelled on the natural working of self redress."
146,"/ The principle of our own law, that taking a man's body on execution satisfies the debt, although he is not detained an hour, seems to be explained in that way."
147,"But the right to put to death looks like vengeance, and the division of the body shows that the debt was conceived very literally to inhere in or bind the body with a vinculum juris."
148,"Whatever may be the true explanation of surrender in connection with contracts, for the present purpose we need not go further than the common case of noxoe deditio for wrongs."
149,Neither is the seeming adhesion of liability to the very body which did the harm of the first importance.
150,"The Roman law dealt mainly with living creatures, with animals and slaves."
151,"If a man was run over, it did not surrender the wagon which crushed him, but the ox which drew the wagon."
152,/ At this stage the notion is easy to understand.
153,"The desire for vengeance may be felt as strongly against a slave as against a freeman, and it is not without example nowadays that a like passion should be felt against an animal."
154,The surrender of the slave or beast empowered the injured party to do his will upon them.
155,Payment by the owner was merely a privilege in case he wanted to buy the vengeance off.
156,It will readily be imagined that such a system as has been described could not last when civilization had advanced to any considerable height.
157,"What had been the privilege of buying off vengeance by agreement, of paying the damage instead of surrendering the body of the offender, no doubt became a general custom."
158,"The Aquilian law, passed about a couple of centuries later than the date of the Twelve Tables, enlarged the sphere of compensation for bodily injuries."
159,"Masters became personally liable for certain wrongs committed by their slaves with their knowledge, where previously they were only bound to surrender the slave."
160,"/ If a pack mule threw off his burden upon a passer by because he had been improperly overloaded, or a dog which might have been restrained escaped from his master and bit any one, the old noxal action, as it was called, gave way to an action under the new law to enforce a general personal liability."
161,"/ Still later, ship owners and innkeepers were made liable as if they were wrong doers for wrongs committed by those in their employ on board ship or in the tavern, although of course committed without their knowledge."
162,The true reason for this exceptional responsibility was the exceptional confidence which was necessarily reposed in carriers and innkeepers.
163,"/ But some of the jurists, who regarded the surrender of children and slaves as a privilege intended to limit liability, explained this new liability on the ground that the innkeeper or ship owner was to a certain degree guilty of negligence in having employed the services of bad men"
164,This was the first instance of a master being made unconditionally liable for the wrongs of his servant.
165,"The reason given for it was of general application, and the principle expanded to the scope of the reason."
166,The law as to ship owners and innkeepers introduced another and more startling innovation.
167,"It made them responsible when those whom they employed were free, as well as when they were slaves."
168,"/ For the first time one man was made answerable for the wrongs of another who was also answerable himself, and who had a standing before the law."
169,This was a great change from the bare permission to ransom one's slave as a privilege.
170,"But here we have the history of the whole modern doctrine of master and servant, and principal and agent."
171,All servants are now as free and as liable to a suit as their masters.
172,"Yet the principle introduced on special grounds in a special case, when servants were slaves, is now the general law of this country and England, and under it men daily have to pay large sums for other people's acts, in which they had no part and for which they are in no sense to blame."
173,And to this day the reason offered by the Roman jurists for an exceptional rule is made to justify this universal and unlimited responsibility.
174,/ So much for one of the parents of our common law.
175,Now let us turn for a moment to the Teutonic side.
176,The Salic Law embodies usages which in all probability are of too early a date to have been influenced either by Rome or the Old Testament.
177,"The thirty sixth chapter of the ancient text provides that, if a man is killed by a domestic animal, the owner of the animal shall pay half the composition , and for the other half give up the beast to the complainant."
178,"/ So, by chapter thirty five, if a slave killed a freeman, he was to be surrendered for one half of the composition to the relatives of the slain man, and the master was to pay the other half."
179,"But according to the gloss, if the slave or his master had been maltreated by the slain man or his relatives, the master had only to surrender the slave."
180,/ It is interesting to notice that those Northern sources which Wilda takes to represent a more primitive stage of German law confine liability for animals to surrender alone.
181,"/ There is also a trace of the master's having been able to free himself in some cases, at a later date, by showing that the slave was no longer in his possession."
182,/ There are later provisions making a master liable for the wrongs committed by his slave by his command.
183,"/ In the laws adapted by the Thuringians from the earlier sources, it is provided in terms that the master is to pay for all damage done by his slaves."
184,"/ In short, so far as I am able to trace the order of development in the customs of the German tribes, it seems to have been entirely similar to that which we have already followed in the growth of Roman law."
185,"The earlier liability for slaves and animals was mainly confined to surrender; the later became personal, as at Rome."
186,The reader may begin to ask for the proof that all this has any bearing on our law of today.
187,"So far as concerns the influence of the Roman law upon our own, especially the Roman law of master and servant, the evidence of it is to be found in every book which has been written for the last five hundred years."
188,"It has been stated already that we still repeat the reasoning of the Roman lawyers, empty as it is, to the present day."
189,It will be seen directly whether the German folk laws can also be followed into England.
190,"In the Kentish laws of Hlothhaere and Eadrie it is said, If any one's slave slay a freeman, whoever it be, let the owner pay with a hundred shillings, give up the slayer, c. / There are several other similar provisions."
191,"In the nearly contemporaneous laws of Ine, the surrender and payment are simple alternatives."
192,"If a Wessex slave slay an Englishman, then shall he who owns him deliver him up to the lord and the kindred, or give sixty shillings for his life."
193,/ Alfred's laws have a like provision as to cattle.
194,"If a neat wound a man, let the neat be delivered up or compounded for."
195,"/ And Alfred, although two hundred years later than the first English lawgivers who have been quoted, seems to have gone back to more primitive notions than we find before his time."
196,For the same principle is extended to the case of a tree by which a man is killed.
197,"If, at their common work, one man slay another unwilfully, let the tree be given to the kindred, and let them have it off the land within thirty nights."
198,Or let him take possession of it who owns the wood.
199,/ It is not inapposite to compare what Mr. Tylor has mentioned concerning the rude Kukis of Southern Asia.
