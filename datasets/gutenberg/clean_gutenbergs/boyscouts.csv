Gen. Sir Robert S. S. Baden Powell, who has done so much to make the movement of interest to boys of all nations."
30,The BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA is a corporation formed by a group of men who are anxious that the boys of America should come under the influence of this movement and be built up in all that goes to make character and good citizenship.
31,"The affairs of the organization are managed by a National Council, composed of some of the most prominent men of our country, who gladly and freely give their time and money that this purpose may be accomplished."
32,"In the various cities, towns, and villages, the welfare of the boy scouts is cared for by local councils, and these councils, like the National Council are composed of men who are seeking for the boys of the community the very best things."
33,"In order that the work of the boy scouts throughout America may be uniform and intelligent, the National Council has prepared its Official Handbook, the purpose of which is to furnish to the patrols of the boy scouts advice in practical methods, as well as inspiring information."
34,"The work of preparing this handbook has enlisted the services of men eminently fitted for such work, for each is an expert in his own department, and the Editorial Board feels that the organization is to be congratulated in that such men have been found willing to give their time and ripe experience to this movement."
35,"It would be impossible adequately to thank all who by advice and friendly criticism have helped in the preparation of the book, or even to mention their names, but to the authors whose names are attached to the various chapters, we acknowledge an especial obligation."
36,Without their friendly help this book could not be.
37,We wish especially to express our appreciation of the helpful suggestions made by Daniel Carter Beard.
38,"We have carefully examined and approved all the material which goes to make up vi the manual, and have tried to make it as complete as possible; nevertheless, no one can be more conscious than we are of the difficulty of providing a book which will meet all the demands of such widely scattered patrols with such varied interests."
39,We have constantly kept in mind the evils that confront the boys of our country and have struck at them by fostering better things.
40,Our hope is that the information needed for successful work with boy scouts will be found within the pages of this book.
41,"In these pages and throughout our organization we have made it obligatory upon our scouts that they cultivate courage, loyalty, patriotism, brotherliness, self control, courtesy, kindness to animals, usefulness, cheerfulness, cleanliness, thrift, purity and honor."
42,"No one can doubt that with such training added to his native gifts, the American boy will in the near future, as a man, be an efficient leader in the paths of civilization and peace."
43,It has been deemed wise to publish all material especially for the aid of scout masters in a separate volume to be known as The Scout Masters' Manual.
44,"We send out our Official Handbook, therefore, with the earnest wish that many boys may find in it new methods for the proper use of their leisure time and fresh inspiration in their efforts to make their hours of recreation contribute to strong, noble manhood in the days to come."

Zabriskie x A MESSAGE FROM THE CHIEF SCOUT TO THE BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA: There was once a boy who lived in a region of rough farms.
73,"He was wild with the love of the green outdoors the trees, the tree top singers, the wood herbs and the live things that left their nightly tracks in the mud by his spring well."
74,"He wished so much to know them and learn about them, he would have given almost any price in his gift to know the name of this or that wonderful bird, or brilliant flower; he used to tremble with excitement and intensity of interest when some new bird was seen, or when some strange song came from the trees to thrill him with its power or vex him with its mystery, and he had a sad sense of lost opportunity when it flew away leaving him dark as ever."
75,"But he was alone and helpless, he had neither book nor friend to guide him, and he grew up with a kind of knowledge hunger in his heart that gnawed without ceasing."
76,But this also it did: It inspired him with the hope that some day he might be the means of saving others from this sort of torment he would aim to furnish to them what had been denied to himself.
77,There were other things in the green and living world that had a binding charm for him.
78,"He wanted to learn to camp out, to live again the life of his hunter grandfather who knew all the tricks of winning comfort from the relentless wilderness the foster mother so rude to those who fear her, so kind to the stout of heart."
79,And he had yet another hankering he loved the touch of romance.
80,"When he first found Fenimore Cooper's books, he drank them in as one parched might drink at a spring."
81,"He reveled in the tales of courage and heroic deeds, he gloated over records of their trailing and scouting by red man and white; he gloried in their woodcraft, and lived it all in imagination, secretly blaming the writer, a little, for praising without describing it so it could be followed."
82,"Some day, he said, I shall put it all down for other boys to learn."
83,"As years went by he found that there were books about most of the things he wished to know, the stars, the birds, the xi quadrupeds, the fish, the insects, the plants, telling their names; their hidden power or curious ways, about the camper's life the language of signs and even some of the secrets of the trail."
84,But they were very expensive and a whole library would be needed to cover the ground.
85,"What he wanted what every boy wants is a handbook giving the broad facts as one sees them in the week end hike, the open air life."
86,"He did not want to know the trees as a botanist, but as a forester; nor the stars as an astronomer, but as a traveler."
87,"His interest in the animals was less that of anatomist than of a hunter and camper, and his craving for light on the insects was one to be met by a popular book on bugs, rather than by a learned treatise on entomology."
88,"So knowing the want he made many attempts to gather the simple facts together exactly to meet the need of other boys of like ideas, and finding it a mighty task he gladly enlisted the help of men who had lived and felt as he did."
89,Young Scouts of America that boy is writing to you now.
90,He thought himself peculiar in those days.
91,"He knows now he was simply a normal boy with the interests and desires of all normal boys, some of them a little deeper rooted and more lasting perhaps and all the things that he loved and wished to learn have now part in the big broad work we call Scouting."
92,Scout used to mean the one on watch for the rest.
93,We have widened the word a little.
94,We have made it fit the town as well as the wilderness and suited it to peace time instead of war.
95,"We have made the scout an expert in Life craft as well as Wood craft, for he is trained in the things of the heart as well as head and hand."
96,"Scouting we have made to cover riding, swimming, tramping, trailing, photography, first aid, camping, handicraft, loyalty, obedience, courtesy, thrift, courage, and kindness."
97,Do these things appeal to you
98,Do you wish to learn the trees as the forester knows them
99,"And the stars not as an astronomer, but as a traveler"
100,"Do you wish to have all round, well developed muscles, not those of a great athlete, but those of a sound body that will not fail you"
101,"Would you like to be an expert camper who can always make himself comfortable out of doors, and a swimmer that fears no waters"
102,"Do you desire the knowledge to help the wounded quickly, and to make yourself cool and self reliant in an emergency"
103,"Do you believe in loyalty, courage, and kindness"
104,Would xii you like to form habits that will surely make your success in life
105,"Then, whether you be farm boy or shoe clerk, newsboy or millionaire's son, your place is in our ranks, for these are the thoughts in scouting; it will help you to do better work with your pigs, your shoes, your papers, or your dollars; it will give you new pleasures in life; it will teach you so much of the outdoor world that you wish to know; and this Handbook, the work of many men, each a leader in his field, is their best effort to show you the way."
106,"This is, indeed, the book that I so longed for, in those far off days when I wandered, heart hungry in the woods."

Alexander and Samuel A. Moffat_."
119,"Aim of the Scout Movement _By John L. Alexander, Boy Scouts of America_ The aim of the Boy Scouts is to supplement the various existing educational agencies, and to promote the ability in boys to do things for themselves and others."
120,It is not the aim to set up a new organization to parallel in its purposes others already established.
121,"The opportunity is afforded these organizations, however, to introduce into their programs unique features appealing to interests which are universal among boys."
122,"The method is summed up in the term Scoutcraft, and is a combination of observation, deduction, and handiness, or the ability to do things."
123,"Scoutcraft includes instruction in First Aid, Life Saving, Tracking, Signaling, Cycling, Nature Study, Seamanship, Campcraft, Woodcraft, Chivalry, Patriotism, and other subjects."
124,"This is accomplished in games and team play, and is pleasure, not work, for the boy."
125,"All that is needed is the out of doors, a group of boys, and a competent leader."
126,"What Scouting Means In all ages there have been scouts, the place of the scout being on the danger line of the army or at the outposts, protecting those of his company who confide in his care."
127,The army scout was the soldier who was chosen out of all the army to go out on the skirmish line.
128,"The pioneer, who was out on the edge of the wilderness, guarding the men, women, and children in the stockade, was also a scout."
129,"Should he fall asleep, or lose control of his faculties, or fail on his watch, then the lives of the men, women, and children paid the forfeit, and the scout lost his honor."
130,But there have been other kinds of scouts besides war scouts and frontier scouts.
131,"They have been the men of all ages, who have gone out on new and strange adventures, and through their work have benefited the people of the earth."
132,"Thus, Columbus discovered America, the Pilgrim Fathers founded New England, the early English settlers colonized Jamestown, and the Dutch built up New York."
133,In the same way the hardy Scotch Irish pushed west and made a new home for the American people beyond the Alleghanies and the Rockies.
134,These peace scouts had to be as well prepared as any war scouts.
135,"They had to know how to live in the woods, and be able to find their way anywhere, without other chart or compass than the sun and stars, besides being able to interpret the meaning of the slightest signs of the forest and the foot tracks of animals and men."
136,"They had to know how to live so as to keep healthy and strong, to face any danger that came their way, and to help one another."
137,These scouts of old were accustomed to take chances with death and they did not hesitate to give up their lives in helping their comrades or country.
138,"In fact, they left everything behind them, comfort and peace, in order to push forward into the wilderness beyond."
139,And much of this they did because they felt it to be their duty.
140,"These little known scouts could be multiplied indefinitely by going back into the past ages and reading the histories and stories of the knights of King Arthur, of the Crusaders, and of the great explorers and navigators of the world."
141,"Wherever there have been heroes, there have been scouts, and to be a scout means to be prepared to do the right thing at the right moment, no matter what the consequences may be."
142,The way for achievement in big things is the preparing of one's self for doing the big things by going into training and doing the little things well.
143,"It was this characteristic of Livingstone, the great explorer, that made him what he was, and that has marked the career of all good scouts."
144,"To be a good scout one should know something about the woods and the animals that inhabit them, and how to care for one's self when camping."
145,The habits of animals can be studied by stalking them and watching them in their native haunts.
146,The scout should never kill an animal or other living creature needlessly.
147,"There is more sport in stalking animals to photograph them, and in coming to know their habits than in hunting to kill."
148,But woodcraft means more than this.
149,"It means not only the following of tracks and other signs, but it means to be able to read them."
150,"To tell how fast the animal which made the tracks was going; to tell whether he was frightened, suspicious, or otherwise."
151,"Woodcraft also enables the scout to find his way, no matter where he is."
152,"It teaches him the various kinds of wild fruit, roots, nuts, etc., which are good for food, or are the favorite food of animals."
153,By woodcraft a scout may learn a great number of things.
154,"He may be able to tell whether the tracks were made by an animal or by man, bicycle, automobile or other vehicle."
155,"By having his power of observation trained he can tell by very slight signs, such as the sudden flying of birds, that someone is moving very near him though he may not be able to see the person."
156,"Through woodcraft then, a boy may train his eye, and be able to observe things that otherwise would pass unnoticed."
157,"In this way he may be able to save animals from pain, as a horse from an ill fitting harness."
158,He may also be able to see little things which may give him the clew to great things and so be able to prevent harm and crime.
159,Illustration: Horse with head pulled back.
160,Torture Illustration: Horse with head relaxed.
161,Comfort Besides woodcraft one must know something of camp life.
162,"One of the chief characteristics of the scout is to be able to live in the open, know how to put up tents, build huts, throw up a lean to for shelter, or make a dugout in the ground, how to build a fire, how to procure and cook food, how to bind logs together so as to construct bridges and rafts, and how to find his way by night as well as by day in a strange country."
163,"Living in the open in this way, and making friends of the trees, the streams, the mountains, and the stars, gives a scout a great deal of confidence and makes him love the natural life around him."
164,"Illustration: Camp loom, for making mats and mattresses."
165,"To be able to tell the difference between the trees by their bark and leaves is a source of pleasure; to be able to make a bed out of rough timber, or weave a mattress or mat out of grass to sleep on is a joy."
166,And all of these things a good scout should know.
167,"Then too, a good scout must be chivalrous."
168,"That is, he should be as manly as the knights or pioneers of old."
169,He should show benevolence and thrift.
170,He should be loyal to his country.
171,"He should be obedient to his parents, and show respect to those who are his superiors."
172,He should be very courteous to women.
173,One of his obligations is to do a good turn every day to some one.
174,"He should be cheerful and seek self improvement, and should make a career for himself."
175,All these things were characteristics of the old time American scouts and of the King Arthur knights.
176,"They were courteous and polite to women and children, especially to the aged, protected the weak, and helped others to live better."
177,"They taught themselves to be strong, so as to be able to protect their country against enemies."
178,"They kept themselves strong and healthy, so that they might be prepared to do all of these things at a moment's notice, and do them well."
179,"So the boy scout of to day must be chivalrous, manly, and gentlemanly."
180,"When he gets up in the morning he may tie a knot in his necktie, and leave the necktie outside his vest until he has done a good turn."
181,Another way to remind himself is to wear his scout badge reversed until he has done his good turn.
182,"The good turn may not be a very big thing help an old lady across the street; remove a banana skin from the pavement so that people may not fall; remove from streets or roads broken glass, dangerous to automobile or bicycle tires; give water to a thirsty horse; or deeds similar to these."
183,The scout also ought to know how to save life.
184,"He ought to be able to make a stretcher; to throw a rope to a drowning person; to drag an unconscious person from a burning building, and to resuscitate a person overcome by gas fumes."
185,"He ought also to know the method of stopping runaway horses, and he should have the presence of mind and the skill to calm a panic and deal with street and other accidents."
186,This means also that a boy scout must always be in the pink of condition.
187,A boy cannot do things like these unless he is healthy and strong.
188,"Therefore, he must be systematically taking exercise, playing games, running, and walking."
189,"It means that he must sleep enough hours to give him the necessary strength, and if possible to sleep very much in the open, or at least with the windows of his bedroom open both summer and winter."
190,"It means also that he should take a cold bath often, rubbing dry with a rough towel."
191,He should breathe through the nose and not through the mouth.
192,He should at all times train himself to endure hardships.
193,In addition to these the scout should be a lover of his country.
194,"How many states there are in it, what are its natural resources, scope, and boundaries."
195,"He ought to know something of its history, its early settlers, and of the great deeds that won his land."
196,How they settled along the banks of the James River.
197,"How Philadelphia, New York, and other great cities were founded."
198,How the Pilgrim Fathers established New England and laid the foundation for our national life.
199,How the scouts of the Middle West saved all that great section of the country for the Republic.
