"I recommend families if possible, to show this to older children only . Some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle . Now that that s out of the way, let me explain about this movie . This is in reality a documentary of a male fox, who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate . The beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score, is breath taking . You had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible, it'll get ugly later . They gave both the fox and the vixen names, but I can't remember what they are for the likes of me . He fights off this invading male, to win her love . They later on create a den, and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs;one of which is blind . There are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family, but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon . The first victim is the blind pup, who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away . The second victim is the mother, who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole . She unknowingly walks into a foot trap . While trying to escape she rips off part of her foot, causing her to bleed to death . The rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree . The male is now a single dad, forced to take on the roll of mom and dad . He alone has to teach them the skills they need for life . It later proves not to be enough, when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own; thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man . I won't spoil the surprising ending for you, but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail . And it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through . I wanted to say that I saw this when it first came out in early 1980s, when we had a thing called Showbiz cable . I was only 4 when I saw it, but I could never understand why they wouldn't let me see all of it . Now I know why, after I secretly watched it when it came on Disney, when I was 9.I felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on . I was moved to tears . But as dark and ugly as it was, it serves a purpose . To let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals, and why they are endangered . This documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species, and I hoped it worked . Its not fake like the True life nature films by Disney, they don't teach about why animals are going extinct . The encroachment of land, the killing off of the foxes main prey, and senseless killing of these beautiful animals;has resulted in them becoming endangered . I wish they would make sequel to this movie,(Glacier Fox 2005)to see if they're being treated better . Maybe have it be about a vixen pup named Teresa and her siblings growing up . This movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes, especially when one of the parents suddenly dies . The surviving parent takes on the roll of both, and tries to teach the important lessons of life . It isn't always enough to protect them when they're adults, especially when some of their lives becomes ruined . Or they fall victims to tragedy themselves . Best all around soundtrack and musical score I've ever heard"

"I recommend families if possible, to show this to older children only . Some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle . Now that that s out of the way, let me explain about this movie . This is in reality a documentary of a male fox, who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate . The beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score, is breath taking . You had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible, it'll get ugly later . They gave both the fox and the vixen names, but I can't remember what they are for the likes of me . He fights off this invading male, to win her love . They later on create a den, and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs;one of which is blind . There are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family, but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon . The first victim is the blind pup, who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away . The second victim is the mother, who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole . She unknowingly walks into a foot trap . While trying to escape she rips off part of her foot, causing her to bleed to death . The rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree . The male is now a single dad, forced to take on the roll of mom and dad . He alone has to teach them the skills they need for life . It later proves not to be enough, when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own; thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man . I won't spoil the surprising ending for you, but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail . And it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through . I wanted to say that I saw this when it first came out in early 1980s, when we had a thing called Showbiz cable . I was only 4 when I saw it, but I could never understand why they wouldn't let me see all of it . Now I know why, after I secretly watched it when it came on Disney, when I was 9.I felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on . I was moved to tears . But as dark and ugly as it was, it serves a purpose . To let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals, and why they are endangered . This documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species, and I hoped it worked . Its not fake like the True life nature films by Disney, they don't teach about why animals are going extinct . The encroachment of land, the killing off of the foxes main prey, and senseless killing of these beautiful animals;has resulted in them becoming endangered . I wish they would make sequel to this movie,(Glacier Fox 2005)to see if they're being treated better . Maybe have it be about a vixen pup named Teresa and her siblings growing up . This movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes, especially when one of the parents suddenly dies . The surviving parent takes on the roll of both, and tries to teach the important lessons of life . It isn't always enough to protect them when they're adults, especially when some of their lives becomes ruined . Or they fall victims to tragedy themselves . Best all around soundtrack and musical score I've ever heard"
