"For an actress used to parts which gave her a sense of intellectual sexiness and dramatic presence, playing Consuelo Craydon seems to put her into throes of complete over - acting, over - emoting, and over - gesturing which, while still a part of her style of acting and more appropriate ten years earlier, makes her look like an extremely mannered performer wrenching the joke out of a situation like water from a fairly dry sponge."

"A woman's nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive . The cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement . Of course B - horror movie queen Brinke Stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature . The only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is Michael Berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard . And the last twenty minutes of Brinke's bloody rampage are quite fun to watch . The special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful . Better watch Scalps or Alien Dead again . Of course I ain't expecting classy entertainment from Fred Olen Ray, but Haunting Fear is too dull to be enjoyable"

"Enter into this sordid mess Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall), a slim, attractive young woman who falls under Kyle's charms after he picks up a phone and flies her across the countryside one evening."
"Claw is the movie's version of Dr. Claw, who was a rather sinister, raspy - voiced man who wore metallic gloves and sat in his chair, his face hidden from view, as he stroked his cat and oversaw various crimes."
"Before the inevitable happened, Welles escaped to a final triangular showdown in a hall of mirrors, which has become one of the classic scenes of the post - war cinema Welles did not miss a chance throughout the whole film to counterpoint the words and actions with visual detail which enriched the texture and heightened the atmosphere His camera seemed almost to caress Rita Hayworth as the sun played with her hair and her long limbs while she playfully teased the young seaman into her web"

"The idea behind the binoculars is simple but very effective, the use of a man made object to see supernatural beings and events that the naked eye cannot see, may even have influenced Alex de la Iglesia in his film La habitacion del nino (2006) of the following year, with which it bears striking similarity."
La Maman et la putain tells us the failure of a character to be what he truly is.
"Through all this, Konchalovksy zeroes in on the individual, with care and affection to examine the bitter longing and regret of the woman who waited 6 years after the war for a fiance who never came back, waited long enough to go out and become a barmaid in a ship with velvet couches and which she quit years later to come back to her village to care for an aging uncle who killed the fiance's father with an axe, the irreverent folly of the fiance who came back from the war a hero 20 years too late, came back not for the sake of the girl he left behind but to drill oil for the motherland, the despair and resignation of the middle - aged Regional Party Leader who comes back to his small Siberian village with the sole purpose of blotting it out of the map to build a power plant."

"* * Possible Spoiler * * * Adam Sandler is usually typecast in Comedy, but in Reign, gives a deeply moving performance . While there are people who showed Courage facing post September 11,2001,Sandler plays Fineman, a widower who is lonely and lost in his own world . Johnson(Cheadle),a practicing dentist, encounters his old College buddy(Sandler)and wants to catch up on Old times .

"The Last Command (1928) is a silent film directed by Josef von Sternberg . It shows us Czarist General, Grand Duke Sergius Alexander (Emil Jannings) in his days of glory . In 1917 he had all the power but after the revolution and the collapse of Imperial Russia he has nothing . He also had the love of a woman, Natalie Dabrova (Evelyn Brent).About ten years later he applies for a small part in a film about the revolution . His old enemy Lev Andreyev (William Powell) is the director who gets to choose whether to hire him as a film extra or not . The Last Command is very good silent drama . Emil Jannings does memorable role work in the lead . Evelyn Brent is wonderful playing the woman lead . William Powell is great as always . There are plenty of scenes to remember in this movie . Like many scenes with Jannings and Brent . And then there is the ending with Powell and Jannings . This is a movie that touches in many parts"
"Darius Rose, who plays an orphan named Chancho, didn't have many lines, but, what can I say, I just enjoyed him."
"Well - shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and art - house connotations all over, it fails because the director takes no position, stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates."
I challenge anyone to see his devastating performances in Hud and I Never Sang for my Father and call him lazy or make reference to his smirk

Her performance as Lindy Chamberlain was inspiring.
"She sics her dog on Elvis until he runs into the water and catches convenient movie pneumonia, then she keeps him doped up out of consciousness in her beach pad so long he loses his job and his apartment so she moves his stuff into her house before he awakens without even telling him (the audience does not know about it either, until Elvis tries to go back to work and his boss has him beaten up for no reason except he deserved it for making this movie, and tries to go home and finds some hateful woman in a slip living in his house)."
"I won't say much about the plot, which deserves to be discovered by the viewer himself, but the performances are true Oscar material; special mentions go out to E. Evstigneev, who plays the old professor with such presence, gravitas and kind wisdom that with barely a word or a gesture, he ends up stealing every scene he's in."
"Even Dustin Hoffman hams it up, and he barely says an audible word"

"Surprising was also Bruce Willis' performance: his I didn't remember very well, but it's beautiful and full of sensibility; he plays a man who spent almost all his life underground, and when he comes to the past you'll share his childish fascination with something as simple as breathing the fresh air of the morning or watching the sun go up."
She is fantastic as a wild young woman who is wise beyond her years.

"I'm only recovering recently with his funny but serious part in Fathers day but then he went on to create another mistake, Bicenntinial Man i think it was called but the point is."
"Nikolaj Coaster - Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise bad - guy, in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch--even likable (and I doubt I'd consider taking on many brutal, psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies)."

Bill Nunn plays a Cadillac - loving mystery man who becomes her lover.
"The Haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography . Yes remakes aren't all bad but remakes directed by Jion Da Bont definitely are . I suppose that the A - List actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson)are there to distract us from the boring plot, ridiculous special effects, and terrible attempts at scaring it's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we don't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed . The storyline is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and ripping out four chapters and then using whatever's left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained . The characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you don't really care about any of the characters at all . Lily Taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is . Lily Taylor isn't made for the horror genre at all . The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghost's and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine . There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad . The house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that doesn't save it from it's brutal everything else . I can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV for no price so I would've been even more pi$$ed if I had paid to see it but luckily it was on Scream Channel . Overall The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror"

Gene York about re - elect for congressman and he presides the financing committee.

"Here is the explanation screenwriter Pamela Katz gave me for why MvT introduced JG as a specific character in the film :...the historical record is very clear: Joseph Goebbels was directly responsible for the release of the Rosenstrasse prisoners, so we needed a way to get Goebbels himself into our film...For a woman like Lena, a woman from an aristocratic family with connections, it wasn't unthinkable that she would make an attempt to go to the top."

"Melvyn Douglas once more gives a polished performance in which, this time, he inhabits the role of a detective who can't place love before duty and adventure, and the warmly beautiful Joan Blondell (who, far from being illiterate, as one reviewer suggested, wrote a novel about her early life) is as enjoyable as ever as his ever - suffering sweetheart . It's almost a screwball comedy, almost a Thin Man - type movie, almost a series, I guess, that didn't quite make it to a sequel."
"Master cineaste Alain Resnais likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family . In this film too we see Resnais' family members like Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, Andre Dussolier and Fanny Ardant dealing with serious themes like death, religion, suicide, love and their overall implications on our daily lives . The formal nature of relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends, they address each other using a formal you .

"Soon Rukh is on a murderous rampage that destroys many lives, ending with his own."
From the flaming redhead herself I once heard in an interview of Maureen O'Hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo Flynn in sword fighting in those days but there'd be no need to put it to the test here.

Brigitte Nielsen plays a sexy antagonist together another bad guy plays Matthias Hues also him good martial artist . The direction is good(the fight scenes also).The rest is OK, with Tony Burton who plays a friend of Kurt killed from Nilsen, and Cyndi Pass plays a bad girl . From producers of another action / martial arts film(Bounty Tracker with Lorenzo Lamas)a good action film . The best film of Martial Law series"

Richard C. Sarafian's slightly longer original cut that played in Japan offers an additional six minutes but cries out to be cut down to a more manageable 17 minutes: the director of Vanishing Point must have thanked his lucky stars when the re - edit gave him an excuse to take his name off the film.

I am referring to Laura Harris a Canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the HBO hit Dead Like Me where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner . I remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader . I felt as though if anyone might make it from this series it surely would be Laura Harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique Nordic blond allure.

Dorothy Malone -who was some kind of substitute for his former German star Zarah Leander - and her brother Robert Stack provide the main interest of the plot .

"The screenplay based on a previously mentioned Stage Play and Lincoln's biographies was written by Lamar Trotti in collaboration with John Ford himself, which was quite a rare thing for Ford to do but final result was simply superb - a script combining elements of the Play with several historical facts as well as myths and legends about the beginning of Abraham Lincoln's life and law practice culminating in a hilarious but mostly heartbreaking trial scene, which is the film's highest point and main laugh and tears generator, where Lincoln defends the two young brothers accused of a murder and have to devise a manner to help their mother too when she is brought before the court as a witness and where the prosecuting attorney (played by Donald Meek) demands her to indicate which one of her sons actually committed the murder obviously obliging her to the making of an impossible choice of condemning to death one and letting live the other."

The other main character, Jack Marlow (an associate of Scott Henderson) is played by Franchot Tone whose performance I found too theatrical and wondered why Carol, for instance, did not notice him constantly and strangely admiring his hands .

"Many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from Nielsen's Sandra - but I believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat - the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled, his movement and vision restricted - Fear and Discipline indeed."

Brilliant star - cast leading with Tom Hanks(Michael Sullivan) has done a terrific job . Great acting by him again . He is an acting legend . Great acting too from Paul Newman, Jude Law and Daniel Craig . Casting is just too good . The plot is quite good . You will enjoy the movie . A great portrayal of the gangster of the 1930's .

A great flick in totality showing what a father does to protect his son . Way underrated for my liking . Deserved a fully deserved 10"

"By the end of the movie, the cute blonde has shouted Kong or King Kong in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they're speaking for all of us."
"Unfunny script (we should go home and write better), ridiculous lines in order to understand the strong Christmanish message (our only aspiration in life is to find love, respect and a good friendship) and a very long trial scene at the end where the agent Hopkins beat the devil (Jennifer Love Hewitt is no sexy or evil at all) for all the bad things she made to this unlikable character."

"The real problem is that you don;'t like most of the characters, including the drab main character Diamond Head, who seemed half asleep for the entire movie; his boss' Aunt Mary', who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on; Diamnd Head's girlfriend / fellow agent(hell, I can't even remember her name) a skinny, wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting; and the singing sidekick Zulu(again, i can't remember his character's name)who wasn't bad in small doses."

"And we (against many of us's will) watched 700's Club, and of course that jerk Pat was on ranting and raving about the bible, and he said Simon along the lines of God says Homosexuality is a sin and I actually heard a kid go Hmm I guess he's right."

Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble.
"Just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another, because as this film demonstrates, who's right is not foremost important, its who is popular, and feared which manipulates the minds of youths, and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen . Tiffani Amber Thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim, and Brian Austin Green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved, and his best friend . This is the kind of film that doesn't get the exposure it deserves . Remarkable, and brilliant, too good to be just a film made for TV"

"The direction alternates between pretty good and downright sloppy (a scene where Darkman rides his train - like vehicle and dodges a rocket - launcher is just plain silly), and the editing is a mixed - bag."

Robert Stack never really got over losing a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as Kyle in Written on the Wind to Anthony Quinn's 12-minute performance in Lust for Life.
Jon Voight does probably the hardest thing of all in this film and that is making his transformation from family man to warrior very believable.
"Ironically, Kiki's love sickness isn't love for another woman, but her illicit, incestuous love for her brother."
And veteran Paul Newman gives one of his best character performances in a long time.
"If anything its problem is that he's trying to throw in too many influences (a bit of Machiavelli, a dash of Godard, a lot of the Principles of Chess), motifs and techniques, littering the screen with quotes: the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims, and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn't want to turn into a movie."
"None of this makes much sense, and the acting is atrocious (Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad, whilst Hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers, which speaks volumes about the others), but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore: Rose has her lips sewn together, before being roasted alive in a fireplace; Jerry is crucified and burnt alive; Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish (!!"
So many people let the end of this film devour the middle and the beginning...I believe that Maya's face during the act was the end...not the act itself...not the vengeance or the meaning behind it...just her face...thank yo

"Deborah Kerr delivers her usual, consummately professional presence, convincingly playing the woman who suffers undeservedly Seberg's spiteful teenaged snot - nose jealousy (fulfilling Sagan's shallow teen fantasy of the Classical theme of there can be only one Queen Bee in the hive); in fact, to Kerr belongs this film's sole great and memorable on - screen moment."
"Lars von Trier's Europa is a worthy echo of The Third Man, about an American coming to post - World War II Europe and finds himself entangled in a dangerous mystery."

"Anders works wonders with the part, and is photographed to look bizarre, while his scenes end on odd, sour notes, and are often choppily edited; but for all this he manages to make Grisby's derangement palpable and disturbing, and anticipates, in a genteel way, the more flamboyant Method actors of the fifties, such as Timothy Carey."

"The narrative, of course, depends entirely on the performances of the two stars for it to be convincing, and they both deliver (their on - screen chemistry is quite incomparable); it's interesting, however, that while Loren walked away with the prizes in their home turf, it's Mastroianni's moving yet unsentimental outsider (the film, somewhat dubiously, does seem to equate his sexual deviance with Anti - Fascism! )"

Despite being mislead the film is actually engaging . The acting from all the cast is excellent and I'd like to say that Val Kilmer is amazing in his ability to get down all the mannerisms of John Holmes .

"For example, the story with the Latino man with the little white girl in the park, who gets mistaken by two ladies as her manny (male nanny) when in fact he's the father."
"And the why (I'm a closet case in a sexually repressed world, so I have to drink to excess and make a fool of myself in front of everyone I know) was so offensive to me and the manner in which he died (as you knew he would because that's the only thing that can happen to a faggot in the Fifties) so ludicrous, wrong - headed and mishandled, I nearly threw my candy at the screen."

"I m not usually a lover of musicals, but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be Oliver . This film is so well made, the characters are well depicted, the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great, my favourite being' Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of Fagin . I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were, so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs, usually it was' Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film . Its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it, it stands on its own . Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been . I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London, the orphanages, the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive, and the film portrays this very well . Also another great reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier, notice his long thin legs, this was bred out of the breed many years ago, they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him, and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times . Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face, Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit . A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit . His a beautiful dog any way, and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy, he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was . This is a great musical to watch if you like musicals, and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way, there's something for everyone in this film"

"Some of the IMDb reviews address this point, but here's my $.02 I am aware of only two--count' em--cinema depictions of Tarzan, namely Greystoke with Christopher Lambert and the Disney animated version, that try to depict Edgar Rice Burrough's rather interesting character (the son of a marooned English noble couple, picked up after their death by a tribe of apes who raise him as one of themselves, and who becomes lord of the jungle because of his superior human intellect before making it back to England and claiming his other identity) rather than the usual Hollywood jungle - man whose origin remains obscure and whose trademarks are his famous yell, his mysterious inability to speak proper English despite long exposure to people who know the language, his habit of swinging on vines, his strength, heroism, etc."

"And yet, with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances, the stars of Evening still shine through, Redgrave, Richardson, Gummer (an exciting new discovery, looking vaguely like her mother, but a very different actress), Danes carrying most of the load - until Streep shows up in the final moments and, of course, steals the show."
"Theo Shall is more sympathetic as Matt than Charles Bickford but when applied to him, this is not the matter of performance so much as the mater of looks."
"His best moments in this film are when he finally comes unhinged and actually punches out a burly woman to steal her bear suit (like the fart, not a joke or a functional moment during this review) then proceeds to run amok like Conan O'Brian's masturbating bear, but with half the hilarity of a bear knocking his junk around."

Great twist at the end, and this episode alone scores 10/10!"
"So anyway a small village starts having bodies turning up that have been drained of all their blood . The local yokels start talking about vampires, of course, and a little more loudly after each body is found . The town sheriff or constable or whatever he is, played by awesome actor Melvyn Douglas, tries to tell them otherwise . When he mentions the fact that the dead have one large hole on each side of the neck, instead of two holes close together, the locals simply then say it's a giant vampire bat . The constable insists that vampires do not exist and it must be a human culprit doing the killings."

"I have this film on a Suevia Film Noir Cine Negro DVD in Spanish as La Dama Desconocida with the original soundtrack Ingles as an alternative language, since despite searching I could not find a wholly English version . I was however anxious to see another performance by Ella Raines after being impressed with her performance as a heroine in Impact playing a sole female garage proprietor . Here Ella performs another heroic role believing in the innocence of her engineer boss and refuses several suggestions that she should return to her home in Kansas (her boss's pet name for her) before solving the missing alibi . The fact that she is secretly in love with her boss is a little hard to believe since he formally just seemed to have had a formal business relationship with her . He had however designed children's homes and playgrounds so I suppose family man had lit up in Carol's brain."
"On the one hand, her story lacks the theatrics of earlier royals thanks to a change in social climate and attitudes, and on the other her story is one that perpetuates because it is notably human."
The actor plays him as a little puppy or a homicidal maniac.
"As for Hayworth, she turns in a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before (BLOOD AND SAND, TALES OF MANHATTAN, and THE STRAWBERRY BLOND are exceptions), and is a memorable siren."
Kaufman is obviously still lapping up the cult status he received for what he did (he certainly is a little cult).

"I specially liked Jeremy Irons, and really understood his character, someone who crawled up the social ladder with very hard work, then fights against those who would take his life's work from him, only he gets so involved in this fight, he doesn't realize reason is no longer at his side, and he ends up a beaten, disappointed man."

"The first segment, Blood Reunion, pretty much sets the tone for the whole thing...a man returns to his home town to look up a girl who had a crush on, only to find that her domineering grandmother refuses to let her have relationships with men, and for reasons which are somehow related to a dark family secret."
"The fractured romance between Wayne and his geisha added a little extra element, and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag - waving effort."

Babyface - Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power- he tries to get her to read Nietzche- she says books ain't never done her no good . Soon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and others . Finally she has had enough and relocates to the big city . We follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank . The dialogue is quite saucy for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted Hollywood production code . Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims . Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collection - I watched the extended version- the DVD has both versions plus Red - Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge . An interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir.
Philip Seymour Hoffman putting in an outstanding performance and is electrifying every time he's on screen.

The movie spends too much time on Bruce Wayne and his romance which wouldn't be so bad in one movie if the romance wasn't so unbelievable.
"Dan Duryea, a perfectly decent B - movie actor who made lots of lookalike noirs in the 1940s, can't do much with this one: young man is accused of murdering an unhappily married singer; when he's sentenced to die, his wife decides to solve the case herself with help from the dead woman's husband."

"For me, this is one of the best movies i ever saw . Overcoming racism, struggling through life and proving himself he isn't just an ordinary cookie, Carl Brashear is an amazing character to play, who puts Cuba in his best light, best performance in his life . De Niro, who is a living legend gives THAT SOMETHING to the movie . Hated his character in movie, but he gives so much good acting to this film, great performance . And appearance of beautiful Charlize was and as always is a big plus for every movie."
"As well as portraying Bourne's quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne, Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and security."

"The movie has a distinct (albeit brutish and rough) humanity for all its borderline depravity - the zippy / lyrical score points up the comic side of their misadventures, and even when they're at their most thuggish (like terrorizing the woman on the train), a semi - pitiful vulnerability lurks never far away (Dewaere sucks on her breasts like a baby)."
"There's not much wrong with the lead actors either: Jack Palance is genuinely scary as a charismatic, intelligent psychopath - the later scene as he alternately comforts and threatens the sick cousin is terrific, while Widmark, as he often did, pitches the righteous anger of the man on a mission at a believable level - most of the time."
"And, then, of course, there is Waterman's hilarious exit in a Smart Car he can't remember to drive on the left side of the road."
"The movie continues to show promise, even though we have our doubts about the main characters, when Posey's boss, Texas Senator' Kay Bee' Hartmann (Jane Lynch, funny as always) hires Posey to watch over her unpopular college - age daughter (Amber Tamblyn, playing yet another woman who's attractive in real life, but not in the eyes of any characters in this movie) while she goes to a Laguna Beach - like vacation spot for Spring Break."
Charlotte Gaionsbourg's performance is top notch and she's by far the reason to watch the movie.
"Instead of treating him like a friend, she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple."
"A would - be female vampire (scantily - clad, as promised by the title) is held in captivity inside a remote chateau and emerges only to' feast' on the blood of willing victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) As if unsure where all of this would lead him, the writer - director ultimately has the human villain actually the blank - faced hero's kinky father ludicrously revealed as a mutant (?! )"

"Traumatized again by these latest events, the woman returns to her violent ways and seeks revenge on the thugs, according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis."

"Russell is Sergeant Todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier."

"I'll swear that some of the humans are rotoscoped - but then, the rotoscoped humans (including Cinderella herself) aren't full - blooded characters in the script, so this approach works well enough."

Jack Cassidy plays the murderer and Martin Milner plays the victim . Rosemary Forsyth plays the victim's wife Joanna Ferris . There's something endearing in the scenes between Columbo and her . How he makes the omelet and everything . Barbara Colby plays Lilly La Sanka . She actually met a tragic fate when she died after a homicide like she does here .

Back for one more question"

With his well - buttered locks firmly in place he preens and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms .

"After all, you do not go to an Orson Welles movie to see a nice simple little plot and a burnishing of the image of a happy - ever - after star You go to see theatrically heightened characters locked in conflict against colorful and unusual settings, lighted and scored imaginatively, photographed bravely, and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first place As usual, as well as directing, Welles wrote the script and he also played the hero a young Irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil, but still retained his clear - eyed trust in the goodness of others Unfortunately for him, he reposed this trust in Rita Hayworth, whose cool good looks concealed a gloomy past and murderous inclinations for the future She was married without love, to an impotent, crippled advocate, acted like a malevolent lizard by the brilliant Everett Sloane There is a youthful romanticism underlying it all, and this quality came into exuberant play in The Lady from Shanghai."

He deserves an Oscar nomination for this one .. And honestly, his is not the only performance worth applauding, Shefali Chhaya is terrific too ..

But, everything changed when she won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent movie L.A. Confidential, and I think I was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance . However, after that moment, her career did not follow the ideal path . Sure, the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies (like People I Know or The Door in the Floor),but we have never seen her again on a substantial character . The movie While She Was Out does nothing to put her on that situation; and it is not only that her character is not too tasty, but also that the movie is really crappy . The screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic . However, Basinger brings some conviction to her character, and that makes this poor movie to win a few points . This movie is full of cliches and generic villains . The work of director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly, because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone . The ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous . I do not recommend While She Was Out at all . This film commits the capital sin of being boring"

"About Gandhi My Father: Gandhi My father is a film not about Gandhi but about his son Harilal Gandhi . On telling the story of a son whose father was one of the greatest humans to walk this earth, the director succeeds in portraying the tale . The film succeeds in telling the story of a mislead son of a father who lead a nation to greatness .

I have liked some previous movies from director Stephen Herek (Critters and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure specially) but on this movie, he cannot generate even the minimum level of tension, emotion or entertainment . The characters from this movie are not only badly performed, but they are also repulsive . Honestly, I wanted all of them to die . The cinematography from this movie is also lame and it seems to have been made by a technical team who makes promotional videos for Hawaiian hotels . Into the Blue 2: The Reef is a horrible movie which is better than the original film, but that's the same as nothing, as I previously said . Avoid this crappy film at all costs"
The scene where Joe finds out the prostitute (Steven Andrews) he hired is in fact a man & Joe starts to chase him around his apartment with two squirting dildo's is simply jaw dropping stuff.
The cornball romance of John and Isobel seems merely in this plot so that Bey will screw up endangering his perfect plan which was being carried out successfully before he loused it up.

"As Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean, post - college image from The Graduate and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to Joe."
"A true anomaly in the French cinema, this despairing work has no equivalent in the contemporary production . One would rather have to look on the side of Louis Malle's le feu follet (1963)(the fire within) to find something not completely unlike Harel's effort . Wry and cynical, having lost all his illusions, the hero, a computer scientist, has got no more reason to live . Absolutely none . Estranged from the human race, he seems to live his life as some kind of entomologist, studying his colleagues . One of them catches his attention: Tisserand - Jose Garcia plays the most demeaning part of the decade-.Then Tisserand will become some kind of prey: all his pessimism will rub off on this poor man . The scene is the night - club climaxes the strange relationship: the hero tells his victim that his life will always be unfulfilled unless he .... Well now the movie takes a more conventional turn so to speak (Clouzot's misanthropy maybe)but just for a while."
"She's like the feminist that has her cake and eats it with a sultry smile: she gets to have a husband, more or less (actually a lot less until the last ten minutes of the film) while obtaining things- a man who dotes on her whenever he can, a new and expensive house with servants, a secretary, money- that others around her aren't getting due to already being with a man or too weak in a position to rise anywhere (such as the secretary, played interestingly enough by Fassbinder's own mother)."

but on the other hand it is nothing more then a cheap action movie (like there are so so many out there) with an average set of actors and a Vinnie Jones who is managing to not totally ruin what's left of his reputation by doing what he always does.
It's just so unbelievably how the bewitched Mallory Doss manages to pull Kenneth Branagh's character around by his nose.

Although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to' Nine Dead' that comes out in November because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called Clarissa Darling or Sabrina Spellman I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina.

"With Douglas on the run from the law, he becomes similar to Dr. Richard Kimble of The Fugitive, hunting the proverbial one - armed man while at the same time, relying on his smarts to outwit fellow agents, which turned out to be quite interesting to watch - despite slick processes, it still boils down to the performance and gullibility of individual agents."

"MAN ON FIRE is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work, nearly headache - inducing montage editing, and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), but which are not necessarily unique to him (witness Oliver Stone's use of montage in JFK or Sam Peckinpah's in his classic 60s and 70s films)."

Amanda Bynes is such an excellent actress and I grew up watching her show :' The Amanda Show . '

I love his impressions of Mr. T, Ed Norton and Ralph Cramden of The Honeymooners, Elvis Presley, and Michael Jackson too . The Ice Cream Man, Goony Goo Goo, is also funny . I saw this for the first time when it came out in 1984.I laughed so hard, I almost fell off my chair . I still think this is very funny."

Look out for a very young Anthony Quinn essaying the role of an Indian brave who participated at the battle of Little Big Horn . This part got him at least noticed in Hollywood"

Carter's star turn here as a disabled young women seeking to complete herself was as good a performance as I have seen from a female lead in a long time.
"What Denis does with this outline of a story is use her camera to explore the loneliness of the soul, the vastness of nature, man's interaction with people vs animals, etc."
"Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up - or walking off the set; Keith Allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage; Barry Foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance, Rhys Ifans does his career no favours after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary."
"Just as he is about to find grown up bliss with the woman he loves, three old surfing friends turn up and convince him to hit the beach looking for monster waves at the Bone Yard."
"The surrounding social logic is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether Todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human - ness or what, but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for Russell's (easy to underestimate) talent"
' One - Round' Jack Sander is called that because he's a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience.
The school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children's fear - the teacher (thinking only of her own safety) runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman!!!!

"The film has many good performances, led by Lukas as the exhausted but determined anti - Nazi fighter / courier, Davis as his loyal wife (wisely keeping her character as low keyed as possible due to Lukas being the center of the play's activities), Coulouris as the selfish, conniving, but ultimately foolish and ineffective Teck, Lucille Watson as the mother of Davis and Geraldine Fitzgerald (as Coulouris' wiser and sadder and fed up wife), and Kurt Katch, who delivers a devastating critique (as the local embassy's Gestapo chief) about Coulouris and others who would deal with the Nazis."

"Ron Liebman might hate it, but he is nearly perfect, and unforgettable."
"I hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people, not just for acting but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty."
"Faith and Mortality...viewed through the lens of an elderly Ashkenazi Jewish - American gentleman and a younger, African - American Jewish gentleman who waver between being at odds with each other and having frank talks about how their lives have unfolded over the years .. Mostel's character is a tailor with chronic back problems, and a terminally ill wife; Belafonte's character is a career hustler, never settling on a regular job, and a fatal car accident leaves him in an odd Purgatory-- he must convince Mostel to renew his faith, as it has been failing along with his wife's health (and his own).. but Belafonte's Levine has his own problems, still pining for the girlfriend he left behind .. Belafonte's character leaves the film before he seemingly should, and so the the ending is cryptic, and the film suffers somewhat from its ambiguous ending .."
"I have never been a fan of Mol, but I cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes."
"While Cusack riffs on his Martin Blank from the aforementioned Pointe he does add some nice touches of his man in black (he does shots of Tabasco sauce to take the edge off), the rest of the cast plays catch up (except sister Joan who is a riot as the high - strung aide- de - camp for Hauser and has one of the film's funniest laugh - out lines: My mass communications skills are finally paying off) for the most part."
Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare - the gangsters moll . She puts in a solid performance.

"Le Locataire(The Tenant)is without a doubt one of the most important horror movies ever made . Polanski stars as a Trelkovsky, a timid file clerk living in Paris, who answers an advertisement for an apartment, only to find that the previous tenant attempted suicide by leaping from the apartment window . Trelkovsky is compelled to visit her in the hospital and there he meets Stella(Isabelle Adjani).Trelkovsky immediately moves in when the previous tenant dies and, at first, is quite pleased with having found such a nice apartment . His happiness is soon replaced by waves of paranoia as he becomes increasingly suspicious of his neighbours, who seem to be trying to provoke Trelkovsky into repeating the previous tenant's suicide . This film is great . Polanski manages to create a surreal atmosphere of dread and paranoia . Plenty of brilliant moments such as the classic scene where Trelkovsky discovers the previous tenant's tooth in a hole in the wall, or the fever dream where he wanders into the building's bathroom to find the walls covered with hieroglyphics .

All the acting is great--Krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but (somehow) has you rooting for him; Soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection--the little smile she gives when Gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling; Hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body--he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with Krabbe in the crypt.

"Mirage is obviously inspired by Spielberg's Duel and Craven's The Hills Have Eyes . Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore .

"I recommend families if possible, to show this to older children only . Some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle . Now that that s out of the way, let me explain about this movie . This is in reality a documentary of a male fox, who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate . The beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score, is breath taking . You had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible, it'll get ugly later . They gave both the fox and the vixen names, but I can't remember what they are for the likes of me . He fights off this invading male, to win her love . They later on create a den, and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs;one of which is blind . There are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family, but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon . The first victim is the blind pup, who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away . The second victim is the mother, who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole . She unknowingly walks into a foot trap . While trying to escape she rips off part of her foot, causing her to bleed to death . The rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree . The male is now a single dad, forced to take on the roll of mom and dad . He alone has to teach them the skills they need for life . It later proves not to be enough, when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own; thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man . I won't spoil the surprising ending for you, but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail . And it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through . I wanted to say that I saw this when it first came out in early 1980s, when we had a thing called Showbiz cable . I was only 4 when I saw it, but I could never understand why they wouldn't let me see all of it . Now I know why, after I secretly watched it when it came on Disney, when I was 9.I felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on . I was moved to tears . But as dark and ugly as it was, it serves a purpose . To let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals, and why they are endangered . This documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species, and I hoped it worked . Its not fake like the True life nature films by Disney, they don't teach about why animals are going extinct . The encroachment of land, the killing off of the foxes main prey, and senseless killing of these beautiful animals;has resulted in them becoming endangered . I wish they would make sequel to this movie,(Glacier Fox 2005)to see if they're being treated better . Maybe have it be about a vixen pup named Teresa and her siblings growing up . This movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes, especially when one of the parents suddenly dies . The surviving parent takes on the roll of both, and tries to teach the important lessons of life . It isn't always enough to protect them when they're adults, especially when some of their lives becomes ruined . Or they fall victims to tragedy themselves . Best all around soundtrack and musical score I've ever heard"

"Quebec Rating:13 + Canadian Home Video Rating:18A I saw Coonskin today . This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight . After watching Fritz The Cat, I wanted to see more of Bashki's films . I saw Cool World and thought it was mediocre and I saw this . When it was first released, the film was very controversial . It was considered racist and Al Sharpton wanted the film banned, he even led protests outside the theatre where the film was playing . The film was only released on VHS under the title Street Fight . It is now considered a cult - classic film and African - American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and the rap group The Wu - Tang Clan are said to have enjoyed this film . I personally thought Fritz The Cat was a much better film but this is very enjoyable as well . Worth watching for Bashki or Blaxploitation film fans . The film mixes live action and animation sort of like the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit . I would have preferred it in full animation but whatever . The film starts off with a reverend and another man racing to rescue two of their friends from prison . While the prisoners wait, the older one tells a story of three men he knew . The film then switches into animation format, we see three black men who sold their house to this man . They decide to make names for themselves in Harlem . So the leader, a black rabbit, kills a big player in Harlem and he basically becomes a big shot . The film moves on as the Italian mafia want him out . The mafia involves the godfather, his three sons who are homosexual and an Italian clown . Coonskin is an entertaining animated film that's worth checking out, if you can find it"

"They should not be disappointed, for Ms. Carter gives a performance in line with the layered innocence audiences have come to expect from her, but under James Cellan Jones' somewhat pedestrian direction (and despite the BBC's uniformly beautiful and well observed physical production), the role's mischievous fire (and her outrage at being underestimated in the last act) is banked at only about 80% of it's potential."

"First, the central father - son relationship makes it pretty clear that the film was intended as a prequel to his Wong Fei Hung film Drunken Master (ideas from this film recur in Drunken Master II), and not Young Master; that Chan backed away from this plan and renamed the characters indicates that he himself was not convinced the material was coming together properly; and, indeed, the film conveys a sense of being incomplete; for instance, the romantic relationship around which half the plot turns is left utterly hanging at the end of the film."

"After watching KHAKEE i felt i'll get to watch another good film but sadly The film is a joke and actually trying hard to introduce Aryeman Afterall his father Keshu is the producer RKS spoke so highly about the film during promotions, saying the film has meat unlike films released that time, I wonder which films was he talking about The film is actually a typical Masala film with loads of comedy, romance, action everything jumbled The ease at which the kids kidnap the family, is one of the funniest parts ever, Imagine kids kidnapping Dawood's family The end is a complete jumble mumble with sudden change of characterization RKS gives his weakest film till date, except some Bachchan scenes the film is a bore Music is boring Amitabh tries to give the role his all, he does his part well, though not his best though he contorts his face too much when pulling a trigger and does a weird look while smoking the cigar His dubbing too isn't matched properly at times Akshay is there for some minutes and just repeats his act and hams Aryeman seems expressionless, tries too hard but overdoes it in some scenes Bhumika emerges the best of the lot The rest are oka"

"You'd think that after such dismal flicks Superstar, Night at the Roxbury, and Coneheads, he'd start to get the notion that maybe he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to movies (and many would argue that he doesn't know what he's doing when it comes to television, as well)."
"I've heard many film buffs complain that Leslie Howard was a wet noodle of an actor, and he was, but I can't think of anyone more suited to play the role of Philip Carey than a wet noodle, for that's certainly what Carey is."

"OK, but does that make this a good movie?well, not really, in my opinion.there isn't a whole lot to recommend it.i found it very slow, tediously, in fact.it's also predictable pretty much through and through.number one and two were somewhat predictable, but not as much.i also felt this movie was quite campy at times, which i didn't really think fits this series and the character . Jeff Fahey plays the main bad guy in this installment.he's a decent enough actor, but i felt he played his character too over the top.i guess that fit with the tone of the movie, which would have been great if i had liked the movie.plus,there were some pretty bad one liners . Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role, but is given little to work with in this movie.the character has not really evolved, as i had hoped.oh well.this is just my opinion.anyway,for me, while this movie is not abysmal, it is pretty bad.my vote for Darkman III : 3.5/"
"Twinned with this, her bright pink costumes that reveal just enough yet cover just enough are particularly outstanding as is the way she moves and talks with that posh, dominant, English accent; sounding like a commanding mistress (Well, she is LADY Penelope after all and you'd better make sure call her that) The whole thing is laughable but the editing is so quick that the kids won't notice but it sure as hell is there."

Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes(nice feet).
"The film builds slowly, with one quietly devastating scene after another, all enacted perfectly by William H. Macy, Donald Sutherland, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter, and the most remarkable child actor I've seen in a long time, David Dorfman, as Macy's son, who delivers his lines as if they're completely unscripted thoughts being created in his mind."
"With the hit - man, we see his caring side when he got hooked up and developed feelings of love for a girl (Pei Pei), bringing about a sense of maturity, tenderness, and revealing a heart of gold."

"I had always been a big Lynda Carter - Wonder Woman fan so when the Sci - Fi Channel ran this movie, I had to see it . I was bitterly disappointed . This is a Wonder Woman movie in name only .

There's none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i.e."

"And Do - yeon Jeon's character is a totally honest and almost brutal portrayal of a woman that found God, but because of life's bitter realities, loses that love for Him she once had."

"Nicole Kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background."
"Howard's performance never seems to go through much external emotion--his eyes are constantly sad, his expression never veers too far away from lost (he could almost be a distant cousin to William Hurt in The Accidental Tourist--dejected, hurt, and absolutely passive), but this is possibly a part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women (played by Kay Johnson and Frances Dee) are making themselves vulnerable to unrequited affections."
"Mr. Scott seemed to bring Scrooge to a more personal, understandable yet highly conflicted level; his role was acted with the great authority Scott always bring to the screen: yet his usual bellicose voice would sometimes be brought to a whisper, almost as a soliloquy, as he would berate the Christmas holiday in one breath, yet reveal his own human frailty in his next line."

His target has been apprehended there and is under heavy police protection- but they don't want him merely to capture their man- they want him taken out.
"I'm not sure if the producers (usually Pancho Kohner) got a kick out of showing a weary looking, senior citizen - aged Bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what, but the shoddy craftsmanship (and terrible scripts) of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated."

"Yes I know talkies had just been invented for the cinema 2 years earlier when this was produced in 1929 but this film showed that much had to learnt about the art of producing films . It comes over as a filmed hammy stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines, rolling their eyes, using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema, which I suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on screen . The gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing as it considerably slows the film . It is now only of interest for Titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film . In next chronological order they could see Titanic (1953) A Night to Remember (1958)Titanic (1997), to see how the cinema's depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years . There have been many documentaries and TV films made including the atrocious SOS Titanic (1979) On my version which is a DVD, David McCallum gives the introduction . It was he who played Harold Bride Marconi's junior wireless operator in A Night to Remember(still the best feature film - please read my Tribute to Walter comments on IMDb under Howard Morley.demon.co.uk)and gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos entitled End of a Dream so he was well qualified to give the narration . Of more interest I found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the 1912 US Senate hearing which is also on the DVD.Actors speak the actual words spoken by Lightoller 2nd officer, J Bruce Ismay, Managing director of White Star, Harold Bride and others including Gloria Stewart (The old Rose in Titanic 1997) whose voice is used for one of the first class women survivors"
"The very backdrop of a big family with many kids needs the mention of an obvious divided attention and love which had to cast it's spell on the unfortunate kid's psyche who was left alone to aspire for unrealistic ambitions . Little did Harilal knew about his aptitude and he gets emotionally carried away with small pleasures in life and fails in front of the huge idol of his father . He tries to do away from mentor - ship which is the basis of any success which had to be seen by those fortunate neighbours in the streets of Gandhi's residence when Harilal vents out his frustration in open . This means he becomes mentally weak and gets psychologically deranged to an extent that he is forced into religious conversions and alcoholism, with debt and dis - obedience fuelling his negative thoughts . He still had shown the sincere love for his mother through touchy scenes and even Gandhi's humble expressions form Harilal to forgive him didn't meet any conclusions in his mind as he always feared the Father, Gandhi."
"The influence of Antonioni's philosophical and austere style and the story of Blowup are clear and, in fact, writer / director Fred Kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which Matiss attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge, or at least who he thinks did."

"This movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded . This movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights, a very fit Stallone putting in a good performance as well, an exciting plot, and a great performance from it's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways . The movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play . The plot and story cries for this movie to make Stallone an extra special human, much like the Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters . They chose to humanise Stallone's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot's style, weakens the excitement factor . Also, the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times . The script should have been more realistic and less talky . Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes . The movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses . They should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie . Instead, they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences (ala A - Team TV series) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops . This movie had a lot of all time great potential . Crisper action sequences, better dialogue and more Rambo / Rocky style emotion / determination from Stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level . I know this was not Stallone's fault . I sense the movie's director wanted to tone down Stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer . Sill a good movie though ......."

"The screenplay from Smother (written by the same guys from License to Wed, something which explains they have anything but talent for writing movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor . Seriously, I did not laugh even once watching this film . Besides, the solid cast I previously mentioned is absolutely wasted . After the big number of garbage she has been involved in (like the monumentally atrocious and execrable Because I Said So),some people may think the career from Diane Keaton is extinguishing . However, it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she has brought in previous decades, on films like Annie Hall or Baby Boom . On Smother, she makes her best effort with her performance, but her character is so horribly written she cannot do anything with it . Dax Shepard has left on me a good impression with his solid performances on the films Baby Mama and Idiocracy . However, he does what he can with his character . Mike White also makes a good effort, but he does not reach too far away . He is a very talented screenwriter (like he has shown on films like The Good Girl and School of Rock),so I would have liked to see he was one of the screenwriters from this movie, instead of only acting on it . Liv Tyler suffers from the same situation of all the previously mentioned actors: being wasted."
