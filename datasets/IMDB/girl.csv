It is because in Hong Sang Soo's film, there are no actual shots of wars, troubles and conflicts . So the idea of establishing power of a province is neither suitable nor valid in the context of this film . If we were to judge this film by its Korean language title, Kangwon - do ui him is going to appear as a cryptic statement about emotional turmoils of its young protagonists whose minds are not at rest .

"), but never again would Streisand sing with the vibrancy, energy, and, above all, the ENTHUSIASM and VULNERABILITY with which she performs here - by the time she gets to that Central Park concert only 2 or 3 years later, she'd been filming FUNNY GIRL in Hollywood and her performing style has become less spontaneous and more reserved, more rehearsed (and, let's face it: more angry) - there's a wall between her and the audience."

"The screenplay from Smother (written by the same guys from License to Wed, something which explains they have anything but talent for writing movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor . Seriously, I did not laugh even once watching this film . Besides, the solid cast I previously mentioned is absolutely wasted . After the big number of garbage she has been involved in (like the monumentally atrocious and execrable Because I Said So),some people may think the career from Diane Keaton is extinguishing . However, it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she has brought in previous decades, on films like Annie Hall or Baby Boom . On Smother, she makes her best effort with her performance, but her character is so horribly written she cannot do anything with it . Dax Shepard has left on me a good impression with his solid performances on the films Baby Mama and Idiocracy . However, he does what he can with his character . Mike White also makes a good effort, but he does not reach too far away . He is a very talented screenwriter (like he has shown on films like The Good Girl and School of Rock),so I would have liked to see he was one of the screenwriters from this movie, instead of only acting on it . Liv Tyler suffers from the same situation of all the previously mentioned actors: being wasted."
