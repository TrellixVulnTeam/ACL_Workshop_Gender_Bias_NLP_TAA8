The Haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography . Yes remakes aren't all bad but remakes directed by Jion Da Bont definitely are . I suppose that the A - List actors (Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones, Owen Wilson)are there to distract us from the boring plot, ridiculous special effects, and terrible attempts at scaring it's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we don't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed . The storyline is like taking the classic novel The Haunting Of Hill House and ripping out four chapters and then using whatever's left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained . The characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you don't really care about any of the characters at all . Lily Taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is . Lily Taylor isn't made for the horror genre at all . The ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of Casper The Friendly Ghost's and the ghost of Hugh Cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for Halloween with a smoke machine . There is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad . The house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that doesn't save it from it's brutal everything else . I can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching The Haunting on TV for no price so I would've been even more pi$$ed if I had paid to see it but luckily it was on Scream Channel . Overall The Haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror

it's obvious Nazis don't go to heaven The plot itself where dashing young pilot Peter Carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldn't have had much appeal to me if it wasn't for the subtext, you see A MATTER OR LIFE AND DEATH is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the British empire as it's replaced by American ambitions.

The star this time around is Arthur Askey (abetted by Richard Murdoch) - none of whose films I had watched before - who is as unlikely a hero as Hay himself and whose personality proves to be just as potentially irritating...but one soon warms up to him, and Askey certainly comes up with a number of witty lines and amusing bits of business throughout to justify the fact that the lead character of the play (and the 1931 film version) was split into two here, with Murdoch acting as the star's straight partner.

I read another user's comments about audio being dubbed, but don't think his was dubbed...after all, he speaks English, right?
The storyline is so shallow my daughter could have done better (she is 3 yrs old).
She punches people she doesn't like and sheds her clothes and inhibitions when the situation calls for it, but she isn't the least bit real and Knightly isn't the least bit convincing, either.
So, like a poor student who has read only ONE of his allotted texts for his assignment, Soderbergh's product is exceedingly limited in perspective.
Dyan Cannon is miscast as his wife (she's too smart and clever herself to be passed off as a ditz) and Christopher Reeve (in the middle portion of the film) seems extremely uncomfortable in the role of the better writer.

Many years later, he would direct The Birth of a Nation in 1915, the movie that would revolutionize film - making and make him one of cinema's first recognized authors; however, a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for Biograph Company in the early years of his career.
At least several scenes were totally new, such as Ogilvy the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the unnamed writer / narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin.

Actually Bacall and Hudson characters do not interest Sirk . They are too straight, too virtuous . Dorothy Malone -who was some kind of substitute for his former German star Zarah Leander - and her brother Robert Stack provide the main interest of the plot .

The instability of the brother and the sister, from a family of rich Texan oil owners, is brought to the fore by garish clothes, and rutilant cars that go at top speed in a derricks landscape.
Well, it's raining, and they're shivering like two drenched pitiful kittens, and they're not sure of the address they're looking for, and, what with one thing and another, George invites them to come in and partake of his pizza by the fire.
I liked the way that they trained Chris Sarandon and the men who portrayed his disciples to sing in Hebrew . Though Sarandon didn't have long hair like any other Jesus would in other films, his looks are pretty close to what a Jewish man would appear.

The opening scenes of the film take us to a checkpoint on a road to Nablus where we also find Noam doing his reserve duty.
He's a very bland actor with bland performances, but it's not entirely his fault, the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions.
He doesn't trust adults much unless they appeal to him, and he has a tendency to break off relationships.
In another scene, immediately after a heartfelt kiss with the female lead, he suddenly remembers the name of his would be benefactor, a woman he slept with years ago.
It is totally inconceivable that they would not have included him in his brother's funeral.
The only thing i liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene.
She realizes that the man who hired her may not be what she thought he was originally.
It's not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke.

Emma (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a graceful, intelligent young woman who has just married off her governess--and confidant--to a marriage which Emma takes the credit in matchmaking.
This unappealing young man, aided and abetted it's true by some ludicrously lax security arrangements and a doctor entirely careless of any notion of professional ethics or patient confidentiality, wanders into the hospital room occupied by what can only be described as a highly vulnerable and defenceless young woman, and on the basis of nothing whatsoever (her chronic sleeping precludes from being able to give anything like informed consent) imagines himself to have some sort of special relationship with her.
The overacting of the leads makes one feel as if Spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about.
Towering talent from Dame Judith Dench as a widow who plays saxaphone with a street musician to help him get the songs right, to Olympia Dukakis as the merry widow living in a Scottish castle on the alimony of her many marriages, to Ian Holm as the drummer who loved all the members of a World War II all girl (more or less) swing band.
Also, I believe that Burns got the Supporting Actor Oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance--I mean, he was good in this movie, but not THAT good.
Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role, either.
Patrick Bergin plays the con artist, and though he falls a long distance from handsome, he picks on plain Janes and has enough screen presence to make one believe the women could swallow his line.
Now Dr. Lorenz is a mad scientist with some strange habits, including sleeping in coffins and injecting his elderly wife (Elizabeth Russell) with the fluid of young brides to keep her young.
Cliff Robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a razzie - worthy performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director Michael Anderson kept yelling dial it down; think zombie, only less lively through his little bullhorn as he coached Robertson's effort.
The problem of this guy is not that he is an ex - convicted.
Oddly enough, the character of the Curate looks exactly like he's drawn in the original illustrations by Warwick Goble, and he also turns in the most convincing job of acting.
She was clearly influenced by the work of her father, by Caravaggio, Agostino Tassi, and other Florentine painters of that period.
I must say that some parts of the movie really did move me (especialy in the beginning), particularly those concerning the unability of Chang Joan to truly help the one he loves, but also that the accumulation of suffering emotionally tired me towards the end.

Boris Karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the Horror genre who ever lived, and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness, and although (or because) his role is (due to a poor script and and directing) in no way scary, it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor.
Orson Welles' performance undoubtedly the low point of his career is pitiable, and still it's the best aspect about the entire movie

The late Darren McGavin IS Karl Kolchak, an eccentric, tenacious, rumpled newsman / monster - hunter who, in pursuit of a story, always finds a supernatural angle; much to the pain of Kolchak's over - stressed, put - upon boss Tony Vincenzo(played with tremendous world - weariness by the also late, great Simon Oakland; you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers!).
The sergeant especially is guilty of using his monotone to bulldozer every single line he has.

Maria hears that her husband Hermann has died in the war so she gets very serious with Bill.
Also any John Wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role
Michael Keaton has really never been a good actor; in the Tim Burton Batman movies he always falls in the shadows of his great villains.
What was so remarkable about him is that he actually created roles in operas that are today in the standard repertoire, yet this is never mentioned in the film.
It also doesn't help that he wasn't even infamous for the terrible job he did, he wasn't even known for producing a poop - chute film.
When we first meet Early in the beginning of the film, we see that he is obviously one disturbed individual.
I find Emma Thompson's writing self - absorbed and unfaithful to the original book; she has reduced Marianne to a side - character, a second fiddle to her much too old, much too severe Elinor - she in the movie is given many sort of' focus moments', and often they appear to be there just to show off Thompson herself.
Reed Hadley is a winning Zorro and he cuts a dashing figure as he gets into a nice selection of scraps (most all of which were reused by the later Zorro serials as well as other serials as well).The story moves and its nicely not clear who the real bad guy is.
The writer's name sounds Israeli or something of that nature but it is clear he doesn't have a clue about the subject he is writing about.
I begin this review of Vanilla Sky with a description of this brilliant man because he once gave us an assignment that has been firmly etched in my mind, like the phone number of a long lost best friend, and it finally made some sense to me after watching The Matrix.

Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies, but creates a whole world of himself in the process.
I especially like the contrast between this role as an IRA man and the much more obviously controlled performance he gave as the IRA man Denis Hogan in Hangman's House.
Zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for Bronte's superb lines, neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten, but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out.
Required viewing if you admire Martin Scorsese and his work
This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something else . Either that or he is simply bad.
My main complaint is that I would have wished for more screen time for Lugosi, and for his role to have a bit more significance.
There is also a porno start (neighbor) trying to make a movie with an actress he does not seems to feel comfortable with.
Lee J.Cobb tries mightily to fashion Barton Keyes, but even his performance is just gruff, without style.
From the little I know about the man and his story, liberties have been taken with the facts, but it's a movie, not a textbook, and so the filmmakers can be excused.
The story is of Benkei, a warrior monk and perhaps demon who seeks enlightenment by destroying the demon of Gojoe Bridge: Prince Shanao, himself a mortal seeker after his own higher plane but this time the power of demons.
The actress playing Zoe seemed a little posy, but she was playing a teenager (and I'm sure I won't be the only one who thought Zoe was a cylon at first, perils of being a BSG geek).
Treads much of the same territory as TV's The Sopranos in terms of the mid - life crisis of a criminal theme (here too he visits a shrink) but is still worth watching thanks to some taut direction from Brommel (I look forward to what this guy directs next), an excellent script, and all around great performances.
Ollie gets back on the roof, and he and Stan end up in a tug and pull squabble which ends up in Ollie falling down and destroying the chimney.
Lots of interesting details lie under the surface, her relationship with her father, the stories of the doomed, her fiance, so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror, but given the sets, the great cast, and overall level of bizarreness, this is definitely worth seeing
She apparently earns an income playing the game but she is revealed to not be an employee of the game company?.
To make things worse, Ben's crazy ex - wife (they don't exactly divorce), Tammy (Julie Belknap) is steaming mad that Ben's left her for another man and demands Ben that they get back together (saying that she can be gay, too! )

I viewed the movie together with a homophobic friend, my wife and her female friend.
A real life journey Alvin Straight took on a lawn mower to get to his brothers house.
Kim Terry, as his wife, does an adequate job even though she does little beyond the hold - your - face - while - you - scream bit.
She swept me into her character - hook, line and sinker.
The Tenant fits into neither of these categories it simply immerses us completely inside Trelkovsky's experience without demanding we actually understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head.
It's more shocking when you consider that Uwe Boll (The mastermind behind this shocking crap and already has some real garbage under his belt) has created something that only happens once in a blue moon.
And Puro's triumph--while possibly not immediately evident to those around her--is no less than inspirational.
I was right because in 1990 handsome Daniel Day - Lewis turn a little bit ugly by playing an crippled person and he did it with a great sense of reality.

Not without its flaws, the most glaring of which is that the Prince is little more than a MacGuffin to help push the plot along - he has very little screen time and even less dialogue, so we never get to know him very well or get a good look at his relationship with Cinderella (which is unfortunate since, according to the making of documentary, the Prince was originally meant to play a bigger role), and a few additional scenes to help flesh out Cinderella herself might have been helpful (there was a song that showed her fantasizing of turning into an army of maids to clean up the house as well as eavesdropping on her step - family post ball to show her amusement at their jealousy, which was cut because Walt himself thought it made her look spiteful).

As for the extras, beginning with the Audio Commentary: frankly, this is one of the finest chats about a genre film that I can remember listening to; Jonathan Rigby gets to butt in with his opinion more than is usual for a moderator but his effort certainly allows director Peter Duffell to touch on every aspect of the production (whereas with some other films, you're left rather expecting there to be more! )

I won't even say how offensive it is (I know it can be offensive to a lot of people) because that s not really what bothers me about the show .. What bothers me is that people watch this and think it's funny ..

The Princess, though no doubt doing what she was directed to do, had no regal bearing, and all the girls seemed to lose the cleverness of their characters - also affected by unwise cuts, which not only took away the female characters already sparse dialogue, but took comments out of context - it was a little unnerving to hear the Princess proclaim; We are wise girls to mock our lovers so!

The film itself took less than a month to film as Johnny felt the strong presence of God guiding him through it . Great credit to everyone involved in this overwhelmingly sincere movie which will always be cherished by its fans .

A murder plot ensues, and all sorts of calamities follow for Welles and his employers, and at this point the story, fuzzy and told at a leisurely pace thus far, goes off the deep end, and the last part of the film consists of brilliant directorial set - pieces that seem to have been thrown in to give the movie some of the drive and urgency its story does not, by itself, possess, and the result is a very watchable and often pleasing at all times incomprehensible mess.

This is a very rare film and probably the least known from Shirley Temple as it isn't on any of her collections . The reason why is probably because it doesn't have a happy ending, unlike all her other films . Its also not a musical, although she does belt out one song called' The world owes me a living'.The film was made in 1934 and originally in black and white, the version i have is in colour and on VHS, i would say they have done a fine job as the colour does look realistic, unlike i would say the colourised films of Laurel And Hardy which are dreadful . The film is good for its age and the story hasn't dated at all, I'm surprised no one has tried to do a remake . At times the film is a little bit to talky as some of the scenes with Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard seem really dragged out, in some scenes they seem to take fifteen minutes to say what they could have said in five . Although don't be put off by this because this film does have some genuinely good moments in it, especially when {Jerry}Gary Cooper steals a necklace, and hides it in Shirley's teddy bear . The tension and slow build up to his actions,{while at the same time his daughter is singing to an audience in another room}is very well directed . Gary and Caroles edgy facial expressions when they are put under scrutiny are also very good . In all this is a good film from the early 30's, accept it for its age

His love for Aditya though, results in his procrastination of the grave issue.

I know that I'm not gonna get sick of watching it . The scenes, the atmosphere, the actors, the story...everything is good . The movie should have lasted longer . I think 120 minutes should have been perfect . I was hoping for a part 2 for this movie . Too bad it din't happened . Jason Patric: you're the man!

Most importantly, Maguire convincingly and believably responds to the events that unfold around him, which adds to the credibility of the overall film and underscores the realism of the presentation: His stoic acceptance of death and the news of those ` murdered' in the various skirmishes and battles; the moral propriety to which those he encounters adhere, even in such troubled times; the betrayal, which because of the nature of the conflict is almost commonplace; and the loyalty and beliefs to which he and his companions cling adamantly.

Adamson directs this ridiculous yarn with his customary all - thumbs incompetence, staging the incredibly awful'n'inept song and dance sequences with a totally sidesplitting lack of skill and flair.
Both churches are at fault here, the Catholic church for forcing such a regulation on the family in the first place and not responding to the violence that came with it and the Protestant church for telling the mother that she should just obey her husband and his priest and not put up a fight.

I wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun Boll told the audience at the film's world premiere and he has, on that flimsy manifesto, succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the director's detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker, he'll need something genuine to say as well as a better, more original way of saying it

While this is perfectly all right, since some scenes must by necessity be left out, it is not understandable that, instead of using the time gained (so to speak) and thoroughly portraying Jane's friendship with Helen, the influence Helen has for Jane's development, the lecture in Christian stoicism that she teaches her, the film nearly exclusively concentrates on the physical ill - treatment of Helen, which is driven to absurd extremes in this adaptation.
She's sure cozy with her dad and he's surprisingly forgiving of her not being around for the last two years.

Now it would be one thing if Zizek himself went about making these sincere, excited, and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice - over as Scorsese does.
Lead actress / producer Bo Derek is rather ridiculous playing the schoolgirl - ish sexual innocent (witness the inept banana scene) and, as was to be expected, she is made to get her clothes off a few times but, as welcome as these scenes were, she came off as far more sensual in 10 than she does here; Richard Harris, then, chews the scenery incessantly as Jane's obsessed explorer father, but John Philip Law barely registers as his aide who meekly shows some initial interest in Jane herself; newcomer Miles O'Keeffe has the title role and he only makes his entrance 45 minutes into the movie, is completely silent throughout except for his famous yodel (which is probably lifted from Johnny Weissmuller anyway! )
Vince Vaughn plays the titular Fred, an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people don't go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother, Santa (played by Paul Giamatti), too much praise for simply being the limelight - hogging, fame - hungry, slightly creepy guy that Fred would want to portray him as.

This director's 1970s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres, including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways; this time around, the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre.

The real problem is that you don;'t like most of the characters, including the drab main character Diamond Head, who seemed half asleep for the entire movie; his boss' Aunt Mary', who had a really weird delivery of his lines and shellacked white hair as well as the a tan that looked like it had been stuccoed on; Diamnd Head's girlfriend / fellow agent(hell, I can't even remember her name) a skinny, wooden woman with a flat way of speaking that is just not sexy or interesting; and the singing sidekick Zulu(again, i can't remember his character's name)who wasn't bad in small doses.

All I can say is, before watching the movie I did not have a hint indication who Annemarie Schwarzenbach was or what was her life story .. and I have to confess that the movie was hardly a help to reach these data .. and even it was not successful to persuade me to do some research by typing few words on google website; however, all I can say is that the actress Jeanette Hain was great with her mute facial expression she really played well and showed a deep depression mental status, as it is in real.

I mean in one scene you see him admiring her for tensity and in another scene he just about takes her head off.
I have heard unconfirmed reports (from a newsgroup) that the reason the Wendigo doesn't do much is that, when the monster suit was built, it wound up so heavy and and uncomfortable (in order to mimic the stance of it standing on cloven hooves, the performer had to walk on his toes) that it was nearly impossible to run, walk, or otherwise perform in it.

Bouzaglo directs his actors with the usual talent, trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them.
Never has anyone dominated a season like he did.
Finally, what Al Gore fails to adequately address is; even IF America decides to follow the global gospel according to Al & implement everything he recommends, how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism?

I'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless Not to be totally negative I doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and there's always a market for horror movies.

' SherryBaby' is quite a painful and sordid melodrama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs - related conviction and fights to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family.
She also finds a mutual friend that accepts her.
( he is a marvelous dancer and singer and he demonstrates his acrobatic skills as well - watch for the cartwheel! )
As horribly casted as he was...he was the best looking zombie of all.
I loved the bit at the end where Andy's character said sometimes I feel he was never here etc ., it was so completely how it really is in a situation like that (which I can personally identify with), then there was that gorgeous classical piece Nocturne I think by Chopin, which was a beautiful way to end (bar the light comedy at the end, which was probably unnecessary).
In any case, looking perpetually as if he wished he could find a mirror to see how pretty he looked, and fancied that he looked quite pretty indeed, he could scarcely convince us that he was writing with a quill pen.
Despite the fact that his character is put in such a totally different situation and the movie is shot in such a completely different style, Peter Falk still holds up well and his presence still somewhat saves this movie.

As Ramon Salazar is too much in love with his own material it is overlong.

Quebec Rating:13+(should be G) Canadian Home Video Rating:14A I have seen Police Story a couple of times now . In my opinion Police Story is Chan's best film from the 80's . He originally made it because he didn't like the other cop film he had to star in which was The Protector . I have not seen the protector so I ca nt compare . The acting isn't too bad and the plot is pretty good . I don't remember the plot well because I saw this film a while back but what I do remember is this film has lots of great action, stunts and comedy just what a good Chan film needs . If you can find Police Story and you are Chan fan then buy this film!

I was greatly affected by the scene of the man and the children who he raises as his own.
The Morvern just described is not the Morvern of the movie; or if it is, most of her is kept offscreen.
The acting is torpid at best; Kiefer Sutherland phones in his worst impersonation of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas looks like he realizes he made a bad choice leaving Catherine Zeta - Jones for the duration it took to shoot this turkey.
I felt so sorry for the character Louise, and she was constantly compared with Esau who was evil, I just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and un - realistic.
it is just so cute watching her fall for him i did not want her to get her heart broken so badly.
Robert Carlyle is a wonderful actor, but to cast him as Hitler is just plain wrong.
Seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone - faced, no - nonsense man's man that we've come to expect, and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well, without ever up - staging him.
Furthermore, it is not a coincidence that Peter S. Feibleman penned both the aforementioned scripts (incidentally he plays the part of the murdered security guard here).

before he could make classics like The Gardner, so I suppose he may be forgiven this initial excursion into mere sociological documentary.
Cole Hauser is very very good in this picture, he humanizes a man spiraling downwards.

Billy Zane was a wuss at first just like Cpl Upham from Saving Private Ryan but then he got a little more aggresive in the end!

One scene we see Cassidy standing at a desk, when a character enters in the next, she's nowhere to be found.
The jokes in the film fall flat, whether if it's a verbal gag like' she goes all moist when she sees you' to a visual gag where Sebastian pushes Kathryn face first into mud.

Dustin Hoffman and his new British bride move to a small English town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble.
Just how threatening and cruel can teenagers be towards one another, because as this film demonstrates, who's right is not foremost important, its who is popular, and feared which manipulates the minds of youths, and influences them to allow this sort of immorality to happen . Tiffani Amber Thiessen gives a powerful performance as the rape victim, and Brian Austin Green is convincing as the guy torn between the girl he thought he loved, and his best friend .

Well - made but basically dreary low - life melodrama which, according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert, writer / director Pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail; given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved, it doesn't do him any compliments - and he does seem to have been a troubled man, as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot!

I m not usually a lover of musicals, but if i had to choose what would be my favourite it would definitely be Oliver . This film is so well made, the characters are well depicted, the costumes are spot on the acting is good and the songs are great, my favourite being' Reviewing The Situation'sung by Ron Moody who gives a brilliant portrayal of Fagin . I wasn't old enough to see Oliver when it was released in the late 60s but my sisters were, so for weeks on end i had to put up with them singing the bloody songs, usually it was' Who will buy my wonderful roses'so i already knew all of the songs before i saw the film . Its a timeless musical you definitely couldn't remake it, it stands on its own . Its not accurate to the book and i don't think it would have worked so well if it had been . I don't think Charles Dickens would be disappointed, as he wrote Oliver to depict the poverty in London, the orphanages, the work houses and about what the poor had to resort to in order to survive, and the film portrays this very well . Also another great reason to watch this film is Bullseye the Old type English Bull terrier, notice his long thin legs, this was bred out of the breed many years ago, they must have hunted high and low to find a specimen like him, and he is exactly how an English Bull Terrier would have looked in Victorian times . Notice he has scars {which is probably makeup}on his face, Bill Sykes had probably used him for dog fighting or for the rat pit . A Victorian Bull Terrier had a record amount of kills in a rat pit . His a beautiful dog any way, and notice he disobeys Bill Sykes after he has killed Nancy, he obviously has his standards his not the chunk head Bill Sykes thought he was . This is a great musical to watch if you like musicals, and if you don't like musicals give it a try any way, there's something for everyone in this film

We follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bank . The dialogue is quite saucy for it's time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted Hollywood production code . Look for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwyck's willing victims . Part of the Forbidden Hollywood collection - I watched the extended version- the DVD has both versions plus Red - Headed Woman and Waterloo Bridge . An interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir.

Trouble arises, as happens in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's melodramas, and as its one of his best and most provocative, we see as Maria (uncommonly gorgeous Hanna Schygulla in this role) will do a two - face: she'll stand by her man, even if it means working at a bar for American GI's and, even still after she hears from a fellow soldier that Hermann has died will still stand by him as she sleeps with a black GI and comes close to bearing his child (that is, naturally, until he reappears and a murder occurs and he takes the rap so she can be safe), or working for a German businessman (effectively sympathetic Ivan Desny) and becoming his sometimes mistress and rising star in the company.

I remember the days in which Kim Basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb Blondie, romantic interest or damsel in danger . But, everything changed when she won an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress for her role in the excellent movie L.A. Confidential, and I think I was not the only one who was surprised by her solid performance . However, after that moment, her career did not follow the ideal path . Sure, the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies (like People I Know or The Door in the Floor),but we have never seen her again on a substantial character . The movie While She Was Out does nothing to put her on that situation; and it is not only that her character is not too tasty, but also that the movie is really crappy . The screenplay from this movie could not be more hollow and basic . However, Basinger brings some conviction to her character, and that makes this poor movie to win a few points . This movie is full of cliches and generic villains . The work of director Susan Montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly, because the movie never gets a good rhythm and tone . The ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous . I do not recommend While She Was Out at all . This film commits the capital sin of being boring

This is particularly true at the closing scene where, after murdering his assailants in cold blood, Dyer gazes at the camera in, what I'm sure is meant to be, a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathise at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral quandaries he has had to overcome, but instead is far more reminiscent of Oliver Hardy looking exasperatedly at the camera after Stan has landed him in yet another fine mess.

I personally like the touching story of the boy and his father that dream with a house of their own and built by them; the story of the retarded boy that believes he pilots a train; the story of the man that raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters; and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather.

When Tsui Hark experiments, nothing and no one can withstand him.

While blondes and brunettes get most of the attention(I'll always cherish Yutte Stensgaard),the lovely auburn - haired actress with the deep voice always exuded intelligence as well as vulnerability(one such example being 1960's Village of the Damned, in which her screen time was much less than her character's husband, George Sanders).She is the sole reason for seeing this drab update of Cat People, and is seen to great advantage throughout(it's difficult to say if her beauty found an even better showcase).Her character apparently sleeps in the nude, and we are exposed to her luscious bare back when she is awakened(also exposed 8 years later in 1965's Rasputin - The Mad Monk).The ravishing gown she wears during most of the film is a stunning strapless wonder(I don't see what held that dress up, but I'd sure like to).All in all, proof positive that Barbara Shelley, in a poorly written role that would defeat most actresses, rises above her material and makes the film consistently watchable, a real test of star power, which she would find soon enough at Hammer's studios in Bray, for the duration of the 1960 's

MAN ON FIRE is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work, nearly headache - inducing montage editing, and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), but which are not necessarily unique to him (witness Oliver Stone's use of montage in JFK or Sam Peckinpah's in his classic 60s and 70s films).

Even worse in this film as the public had grown tired of musicals virtually all of the musical numbers have been deleted . So we are left with a comedy of that period with little real appeal .

The beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score, is breath taking . You had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible, it'll get ugly later . They gave both the fox and the vixen names, but I can't remember what they are for the likes of me . He fights off this invading male, to win her love . They later on create a den, and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs;one of which is blind . There are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family, but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon . The first victim is the blind pup, who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away . The second victim is the mother, who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole . She unknowingly walks into a foot trap . While trying to escape she rips off part of her foot, causing her to bleed to death . The rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree . The male is now a single dad, forced to take on the roll of mom and dad . He alone has to teach them the skills they need for life . It later proves not to be enough, when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own; thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man . I won't spoil the surprising ending for you, but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail . And it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through . I wanted to say that I saw this when it first came out in early 1980s, when we had a thing called Showbiz cable . I was only 4 when I saw it, but I could never understand why they wouldn't let me see all of it . Now I know why, after I secretly watched it when it came on Disney, when I was 9.I felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on . I was moved to tears . But as dark and ugly as it was, it serves a purpose . To let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals, and why they are endangered . This documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species, and I hoped it worked . Its not fake like the True life nature films by Disney, they don't teach about why animals are going extinct . The encroachment of land, the killing off of the foxes main prey, and senseless killing of these beautiful animals;has resulted in them becoming endangered . I wish they would make sequel to this movie,(Glacier Fox 2005)to see if they're being treated better . Maybe have it be about a vixen pup named Teresa and her siblings growing up . This movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes, especially when one of the parents suddenly dies . The surviving parent takes on the roll of both, and tries to teach the important lessons of life . It isn't always enough to protect them when they're adults, especially when some of their lives becomes ruined . Or they fall victims to tragedy themselves . Best all around soundtrack and musical score I've ever heard

Quebec Rating:13 + Canadian Home Video Rating:18A I saw Coonskin today . This film is also known as Bustin Out and Street Fight . After watching Fritz The Cat, I wanted to see more of Bashki's films . I saw Cool World and thought it was mediocre and I saw this . When it was first released, the film was very controversial . It was considered racist and Al Sharpton wanted the film banned, he even led protests outside the theatre where the film was playing . The film was only released on VHS under the title Street Fight . It is now considered a cult - classic film and African - American celebrities such as comedian Richard Pryor, director Spike Lee and the rap group The Wu - Tang Clan are said to have enjoyed this film . I personally thought Fritz The Cat was a much better film but this is very enjoyable as well . Worth watching for Bashki or Blaxploitation film fans . The film mixes live action and animation sort of like the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit . I would have preferred it in full animation but whatever . The film starts off with a reverend and another man racing to rescue two of their friends from prison . While the prisoners wait, the older one tells a story of three men he knew . The film then switches into animation format, we see three black men who sold their house to this man . They decide to make names for themselves in Harlem . So the leader, a black rabbit, kills a big player in Harlem and he basically becomes a big shot . The film moves on as the Italian mafia want him out . The mafia involves the godfather, his three sons who are homosexual and an Italian clown . Coonskin is an entertaining animated film that's worth checking out, if you can find it

They should not be disappointed, for Ms. Carter gives a performance in line with the layered innocence audiences have come to expect from her, but under James Cellan Jones' somewhat pedestrian direction (and despite the BBC's uniformly beautiful and well observed physical production), the role's mischievous fire (and her outrage at being underestimated in the last act) is banked at only about 80% of it's potential.

But whereas (for instance) in Lang's The Big Heat (1953) the home life of the hero is destroyed by elements of vice surrounding the embattled central character - ultimately sending him back to work with an increased vigilance and sense of vengeance - Panic In The Streets places Reed's rising anxiousness within the confines of what amounts to just another working' day'.

Howard's performance never seems to go through much external emotion--his eyes are constantly sad, his expression never veers too far away from lost (he could almost be a distant cousin to William Hurt in The Accidental Tourist--dejected, hurt, and absolutely passive), but this is possibly a part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women (played by Kay Johnson and Frances Dee) are making themselves vulnerable to unrequited affections.

Yes I know talkies had just been invented for the cinema 2 years earlier when this was produced in 1929 but this film showed that much had to learnt about the art of producing films . It comes over as a filmed hammy stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines, rolling their eyes, using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema, which I suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on screen . The gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing as it considerably slows the film . It is now only of interest for Titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film . In next chronological order they could see Titanic (1953) A Night to Remember (1958)Titanic (1997), to see how the cinema's depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years . There have been many documentaries and TV films made including the atrocious SOS Titanic (1979) On my version which is a DVD, David McCallum gives the introduction . It was he who played Harold Bride Marconi's junior wireless operator in A Night to Remember(still the best feature film - please read my Tribute to Walter comments on IMDb under Howard Morley.demon.co.uk)and gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos entitled End of a Dream so he was well qualified to give the narration . Of more interest I found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the 1912 US Senate hearing which is also on the DVD.Actors speak the actual words spoken by Lightoller 2nd officer, J Bruce Ismay, Managing director of White Star, Harold Bride and others including Gloria Stewart (The old Rose in Titanic 1997) whose voice is used for one of the first class women survivors

He tries to do away from mentor - ship which is the basis of any success which had to be seen by those fortunate neighbours in the streets of Gandhi's residence when Harilal vents out his frustration in open . This means he becomes mentally weak and gets psychologically deranged to an extent that he is forced into religious conversions and alcoholism, with debt and dis - obedience fuelling his negative thoughts . He still had shown the sincere love for his mother through touchy scenes and even Gandhi's humble expressions form Harilal to forgive him didn't meet any conclusions in his mind as he always feared the Father, Gandhi.

This movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded . This movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights, a very fit Stallone putting in a good performance as well, an exciting plot, and a great performance from it's main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways . The movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play . The plot and story cries for this movie to make Stallone an extra special human, much like the Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters . They chose to humanise Stallone's character in this one which is ok but considering the plot's style, weakens the excitement factor . Also, the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times . The script should have been more realistic and less talky . Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes . The movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses . They should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie . Instead, they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences (ala A - Team TV series) as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops . This movie had a lot of all time great potential . Crisper action sequences, better dialogue and more Rambo / Rocky style emotion / determination from Stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level . I know this was not Stallone's fault . I sense the movie's director wanted to tone down Stallone's character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer . Sill a good movie though .......
But their time traveling machine doesn't work perfectly yet and he is accidentally sent to 1990, where he meets Dr. Kathryn Railly, a psychiatrist, and Jeffrey Goines, the insane son of a famous scientist and virus expert...What I like so much about this movie is the fact that it is never clear whether all what you are seeing is real or not.

The screenplay from Smother (written by the same guys from License to Wed, something which explains they have anything but talent for writing movies) is full of cheap and predictable humor . Seriously, I did not laugh even once watching this film . Besides, the solid cast I previously mentioned is absolutely wasted . After the big number of garbage she has been involved in (like the monumentally atrocious and execrable Because I Said So),some people may think the career from Diane Keaton is extinguishing . However, it is impossible for me to forget the excellent performances she has brought in previous decades, on films like Annie Hall or Baby Boom . On Smother, she makes her best effort with her performance, but her character is so horribly written she cannot do anything with it . Dax Shepard has left on me a good impression with his solid performances on the films Baby Mama and Idiocracy . However, he does what he can with his character . Mike White also makes a good effort, but he does not reach too far away . He is a very talented screenwriter (like he has shown on films like The Good Girl and School of Rock),so I would have liked to see he was one of the screenwriters from this movie, instead of only acting on it .
