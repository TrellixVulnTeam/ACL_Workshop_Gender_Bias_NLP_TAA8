THE NATURE OF MIND READING.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Only a few years ago the general public was in almost total ignorance of the great truth of Thought Transference, Thought Projection, Telepathy, or Mind Reading.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is true that here and there were to be found a few scientists earnestly investigating and eagerly uncovering the hidden truths concerning the subjects.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the mass of the people were either entirely ignorant of the subject, or else were intensely skeptical of any thing concerning the matter, laughing to scorn the daring thinker who ventured to express his interest or belief in this great scientific phenomena.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But how different to-day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On all hands we hear of the wonders of Thought Transference, or Telepathy, as it is called.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Scientific men write and teach of its fascinating manifestations, and even the general public has heard much of the new science and believes more or less in it, according to the degree of intelligence and knowledge concerning the subject possessed by the individual.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Listen to these words from the lips of some of the greatest scientists of the day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Prof. William James, the eminent instructor at Harvard University, says: When from our present advanced standpoint we look back upon the past stages of human thought, whether it be scientific thought or theological thought, we are amazed that a universe which appears to us of so vast and mysterious a complication should ever have seemed to anyone so little and plain a thing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether it be Descartes' world or Newton's; whether it be that of the Materialists of the last century, or that of the Bridgewater treatises of our own, it is always the same to us--incredibly perspectiveless and short.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Even Lyell's, Faraday's, Mill's and Darwin's consciousness of their respective subjects are already beginning to put on an infantile and innocent look.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These remarks are doubly significant by reason of their having been made by Prof. James as the president of the Society for Psychical Research.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The eminent English scientist, Sir William Crookes, in his address as president of the Royal Society, at Bristol, England, a few years ago, said: Were I now introducing for the first time these inquiries to the world of science, I should choose a starting point different from that of old, where we formerly began.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It would be well to begin with telepathy; with the fundamental law, as I believe it to be, that _thoughts and images may be transferred from one mind to another without the agency of the recognized organs of sense_--that knowledge may enter the human mind without being communicated in any hitherto known or recognized ways.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Although the inquiry has elicited important facts with reference to the mind, it has not yet reached the scientific stage of certainty which would enable it to be usefully brought before one of our sections.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I will therefore confine myself to pointing out the direction in which scientific investigation can legitimately advance.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"If telepathy take place, we have two physical facts--the physical change in the brain of A. the suggestor, and the analogous physical change in the brain of B. the recipient of the suggestion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Between these two physical events there must exist a train of physical causes.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whenever the connecting sequence of intermediate causes begins to be revealed, the inquiry will then come within the range of one of the sections of the British Association.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Such a sequence can only occur through an intervening medium.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All the phenomena of the Universe are presumably in some way continuous, and it is unscientific to call in the aid of mysterious agencies when with every fresh advance in knowledge, it is shown that ether vibrations have powers and attributes abundantly equal to any demand--even the transmission of thought.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Prof. Crookes then went on to say: It is supposed by some physiologists that the essential cells of nerves do not actually touch, but are separated by a narrow gap which widens in sleep while it narrows almost to extinction during mental activity.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This condition is so singularly like that of a Branly or Lodge coherer (a device which has led Marconi to the discovery of wireless telegraphy) as to suggest a further analogy.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The structure of brain and nerve being similar, it is conceivable that there may be present masses of such nerve coherers in the brain whose special function it may be to receive impulses brought from without through the connecting sequence of ether waves of appropriate order of magnitude.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Roentgen has familiarized us with an order of vibrations of extreme minuteness compared with the smallest waves of which we have hitherto been acquainted, and of dimensions comparable with the distances between the centers of the atoms of which the material universe is built up; and there is no reason for believing that we have here reached the limit of frequency.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is known that the action of thought is accompanied by certain molecular movements in the brain, and here we have physical vibrations capable from their extreme minuteness of acting direct upon individual molecules, while their rapidity approaches that of the internal and external movements of the atoms themselves.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"A formidable range of phenomena must be scientifically sifted before we effectually grasp a faculty so strange, so bewildering, and for ages so inscrutable, as the direct action of mind on mind.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been said that nothing worth the proving can be proved, nor yet disproved.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"True this may have been in the past, it is true no longer.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The science of our century has forged weapons of observation and analysis by which the veriest tyro may profit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Science has trained and fashioned the average mind into habits of exactitude and disciplined perception, and in so doing has fortified itself for tasks higher, wider and incomparably more wonderful than even the wisest among our ancestors imagined.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Like the souls in Plato's myth that follow the chariot of Zeus, it has ascended to a point of vision far above the earth.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is henceforth open to science to transcend all we now think we know of matter, and to gain new glimpses of a profounder scheme of Cosmic Law.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In old Egyptian days a well-known inscription was carved over the portal of the Temple of Isis: 'I am whatever has been, is, or ever will be; and my veil no man hath yet lifted.'",1,0,0,0,0,0
Not thus do modern seekers after truth confront Nature--the word that stands for the baffling mysteries of the Universe.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Steadily, unflinchingly, we strive to pierce the inmost heart of Nature, from what she is, to reconstruct what she has been, and to prophesy what she yet shall be.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Veil after veil we have lifted, and her face grows more beautiful, august and wonderful with every barrier that is withdrawn.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Camille Flamarrion, the eminent French astronomer, is a believer in Thought Transference and Mind Reading, and has written the following expression of his convictions on this subject: We sum up, therefore, our preceding observations by the conclusion that _one mind can act at a distance upon another, without the habitual medium of words, or any other visible means of communication_.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It appears to us altogether unreasonable to reject this conclusion if we accept the facts.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"There is nothing unscientific, nothing romantic, in admitting that an idea can influence the brain from a distance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The action of one human being upon another, from a distance is a scientific fact; it is as certain as the existence of Paris, of Napoleon, of Oxygen, or of Sirius.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The same authority has also said There can be no doubt that our psychical force creates a movement of the ether, _which transmits itself afar like all movements of ether and becomes perceptible to brains in harmony with our own_.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The transformation of a psychic action into an ethereal movement, and the reverse, may be analogous to what takes place on a telephone, where the receptive plate, which is identical with the plate at the other end, reconstructs the sonorous movement transmitted, not by means of sound, but by electricity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have quoted at length from this eminent authority to show once and for all that this great science of MIND-READING is recognized, and approved of by the highest authorities on Modern Science, and also to give our students the benefit of the current scientific theories upon the subject.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In this work we have but very little to say about theory, but shall confine ourselves to facts, and actual instruction.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Science knows and has proven that thoughts may be and have been transmitted from one mind to another, in some cases over thousands of miles of space, but it has not as yet solved the mystery of the Why of the subject, and contents itself with explaining the How.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The nearest approach to a correct theory seems to be the one which compares the mind with the wireless telegraph, and which supposes that the vibrations of thought travel through the ether, just as do the waves of this high order of electricity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The mind of one person acts like a transmitter of the wireless telegraph, while the mind of the other acts as a receiver of the same set of instruments.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are undoubtedly vibrations set up in the brain when one thinks, and there are undoubtedly waves of thought just as there are waves of electricity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Science informs us that there is an increase of temperature in the human brain during periods of thought-activity, and also that there are constant chemical changes in the structure going on when the brain cells are active.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is akin to the generation of electricity in a battery, and undoubtedly acts in the same way in producing vibrations, and transmitting them to the brain of another.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Sir William Crookes, in the address just quoted, points out the direction of the scientific theories concerning the matter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, this is all that we shall have to say about the theory of Mind Reading.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We shall now pass on to the actual practical instruction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The student is asked, however, to always carry in his mind the fact that Mind travels in waves from one brain to another just as electricity travels from the Transmitter to the Receiver.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"By holding this picture in your mind, you will have the whole practical theory, in condensed form, right before you, so that you may be able to act accordingly.",1,0,0,0,0,0
THE PROOFS OF MIND READING.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As we have said in the previous chapter, the general public is gradually awakening to the knowledge of the reality of Mental Transference, and it is scarcely necessary to devote the time and space to a proof of the reality of the phenomena in these days, although a few years ago a work on the subject would have had to be composed principally of evidences and proofs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, nevertheless, it may be well for us to take a hasty look at the nature of the proof in this work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nearly everyone has had evidences of Mind Reading or Thought Transference in his or her own life.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Nearly every one has had experiences of being in a person's company when one of the two would make a remark and the other, somewhat startled, would exclaim, Why, that's just what I was going to say, or words to that effect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nearly every one has had experiences of knowing what a second person was going to say before the person spoke.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, likewise common is the experience of thinking of a person a few moments before the person came into sight.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Many of us have suddenly found ourselves thinking of a person who had been out of our minds for months, or years, when all of a sudden the person himself would appear.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"These instances are so common as to be generally recognized, without question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These occurrences have given rise to the two common sayings, viz., Speak of the devil and his imps appear, or Speak of angels and you hear the rustle of their wings.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Mark Twain, in an article printed several years ago, spoke of a plan that he had frequently practiced, i.e., that of writing a letter to a person upon some subject, then addressing the envelope and inserting the letter, and then tearing the whole thing into pieces instead of sending it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"He stated that in a large percentage of such cases he would receive within a short time a letter from the person to whom the destroyed letter had been addressed, answering the questions asked, or else speaking along the same lines as those of the destroyed letter.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"We have known of this experiment being tried on people thousands of miles away from the writer, and also in cases in which the other person had not been heard of for many years.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There is a field open for experiment along these lines which some of our students might investigate with profit and satisfaction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Perhaps the best available evidence of Mind Reading at the disposal of the public to-day is that found in the records of the English Society for Psychical Research.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The experiments of the members of this Society and other investigators have resulted in the piling up of a mass of facts more than sufficient to fully establish the correctness of the theory of Mind Reading.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Series of carefully managed experiments have been conducted, the results of which have conclusively proven that the thought-waves set into motion by the mind of one person may be consciously received by the mind of another.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We shall quote here from the reports of those investigators, in order to show you the important results that have been obtained, and to set at rest forever any lurking doubts as to the reality of the phenomena which may still find lodgment in your mind.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Remember, please, that these committees were composed of some of the leading scientific authorities of England--men whose standing and reliability, as well as whose judgment, was beyond question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These cases form a part of the scientific records of the English Society.,0,0,0,0,0,0
THE CREERY EXPERIMENTS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One of the interesting series of experiments conducted by members of the English Society was that of the family of the Rev.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A.M. Creery, of Derbyshire, England.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This investigation was made upon hearing the report of the Rev.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Mr Creery regarding a number of experiments he had conducted with his four children.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"He reported that he had begun by practicing a variation of what is generally known as the willing game, in which one of the party leaves the room, and the company selects some object to be hidden, after which the person is recalled to the room when the company concentrates its mind upon the hidden object, and the seeker eventually finds it by means of Mind Reading.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The reverend gentleman said in his report to the Society: We began by selecting the simplest objects in the room; then chose names of towns, people, dates, cards out of a pack, lines from different poems, etc., any thing or series of ideas that those present could keep before the mind steadily.",1,1,1,1,0,0
The children seldom made a mistake.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have seen seventeen cards chosen by myself, named right in succession without any mistake.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"We soon found that a great deal depended upon the steadiness with which the ideas were kept before the minds of the thinkers, and upon the energy with which they willed the ideas to pass.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I may say that this faculty is not confined to the members of one family; it is much more general than we imagine.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"To verify this conclusion I invited two of a neighbor's children to join us in our experiment, and very excellent results we secured from them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The Society then began a series of careful investigations extending over a period of one year.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The utmost care was taken to obviate the chance of fraud, collusion, mistakes, or outside influences.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The experiments were conducted partly in Mr Creery's house and partly in rooms selected by the members of the investigating committee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Having selected at random one of the children, the child would be taken from the room and accompanied by a member of the committee would wait out of sight or hearing of the room.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The remainder of the committee would then select a card from a pack, or else write down a name or number which occurred to them at the moment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The following verbatim report of what followed will give you an idea of the results generally obtained.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The report goes on to say: On re-entering the room the little girl would usually stand with her face to the wall, placed thus by us.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"But sometimes she would stand with her eyes directed toward the ground for a period of silence varying from a few seconds to a minute, till she called out to us some number, card or what it might be.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"The report states that in the case of giving the names of objects chosen, the child scored six cases out of fourteen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the case of naming of small objects held in the hands of members of the committee, she scored _five out of six_.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In the case of naming cards she scored six out of thirteen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the case of stating fictitious names chosen by the committee she scored, at a first trial, five out of ten.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"One of the experiments is reported as follows: One of the children was sent into an adjoining room, the door of which was closed.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The committee then thought of some object in the house and wrote the name down on paper.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The strictest silence was observed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We then all silently thought of the name of the thing selected.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In a few seconds the door of the adjoining room opened, and the child would appear _generally with the object selected_.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"No one was allowed to leave the room after the object had been fixed upon; no communication with the child was conceivable, as her place was often changed.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Further, the only instructions given to the child were to fetch some object in the house that we would fix upon and would keep in mind to the exclusion of all other ideas.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In this way we wrote down, among other things, a hairbrush--it was brought; an orange--it was brought; a wine-glass--it was brought; an apple--it was brought, etc., etc.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The report to the Society sums up the following results: Three hundred and eighty-two trials were made in the series.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the test of naming the chosen letters of the alphabet, cards, and numbers of two figures, the chances against the girl were 21 to 1, 51 to 1, and 89 to 1, respectively.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In the case of stating chosen surnames the odds against her were very much in excess of the figures just named.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the cases of the experiments of naming chosen cards it was calculated that a mere guesser, according to the law of probability, would be able to correctly name _but seven and one-third_ out of a total of the three hundred and eighty-two trials.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The actual results obtained by the child were as follows: On the first attempt, _one hundred and twenty-seven_; on the second attempt, fifty-six additional; and on the third attempt, _nineteen additional_--making a grand total of two hundred and two successes _out of a possible three hundred and eighty-two_!",1,0,0,0,0,0
On one occasion _five cards straight running_ were successfully named on a first trial.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The mathematical chances of a mere guess doing this feat, under the Law of Average, or Probabilities, are estimated at over _a million to one against the chance_.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this was not merely an isolated, exceptional case, for there were other long runs; for instance, there were two cases in which runs of _eight straight consecutive successes_ were scored, once with names, and once with cards.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the case of the eight consecutive cards it has been figured that the chances against the girl would figure up at least 140,000,000 to 1, according to the Law of Average and Probabilities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To understand just what this means it may help you if you will think that the feat was like picking out one chosen man in a population of one hundred and forty millions, nearly double the population of the United States.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And yet there are people who would dismiss matters like this with the remark, mere coincidence!",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The interest in the Creery children attracted the notice of Prof. Balfour Stewart, LL.D., and Fellow of the Royal Society.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This distinguished gentleman testifies as follows: In the first instance, when I was present, the thought-reader was outside a door.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The object or thing thought of was written on paper and silently handed to the company in the room.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The thought-reader was then called in, and in the course of perhaps a minute the answer was given.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Definite objects in the room, for instance, were first thought of, and in the majority of cases the answers were correct.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These numbers were thought of and the answers were generally right, but, of course, there were some cases of error.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The names of towns were thought of, and a good many of these were right.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Then fancy names were thought of.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I was asked to think of certain fancy names and mark them down and hand them around to the company.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I then thought of, and wrote on paper, 'Bluebeard,' 'Tom Thumb,' 'Cinderella,' and the answers were all correct.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Subsequent experiments with the Creery children, at the house of the well known investigator, Mr F.W.H.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"The children, and their ages, were as follows: Mary, 17; Alice, 15; Maud, 13.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The percentage of successes obtained at Mr Myers' house tallied very well with those obtained elsewhere.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One remarkable result was obtained, though, that had not been obtained before.",1,0,0,0,0,0
On one occasion the child was asked to name the suit of cards chosen one after another.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is, of course, the child was asked to name which suit, hearts, diamonds, clubs or spades, were shown of the card drawn and seen by the committee, and then thought of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On this occasion the child scored a run of _fourteen straight running, consecutive successes_.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The chances against this success were 4,782,969 to 1.",0,0,0,0,0,0
We will close by mentioning another remarkable series of experiments conducted by the same Society.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Smith, of England.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Among other startling feats successfully performed by Mr Smith, that of the reproduction of Geometrical Figures was perhaps the most remarkable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In this feat Mr Smith sat blindfolded, in a room belonging to the committee, with a pad of paper before him and a member of the committee on each side of him.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"A selected member of the committee then would go outside of the room, and behind a closed door would draw some geometrical figure at random.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Returning to the room the figure would be shown to the committee, and also to Mr Douglas Blackburn, who acted as the Transmitter for Mr Smith, the latter being known as the Receiver.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Transmitter, with closed eyes, now took his position immediately back of Mr Smith, but at a distance of two feet from him, no contact being allowed, this precaution being taken to obviate charges of confederacy, etc.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The Transmitter would then concentrate his mind intently for a few minutes, and in a short time Mr Smith would receive the impression of the mental image in the mind of the Transmitter, and would begin to attempt to reproduce it on paper.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"In the series of experiments running over a period of four days thirty-seven drawings were made, of which only eight were considered unsuccessful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"_Twenty-nine successes out of a possible thirty-seven, remember._ The committee reports that it took all the precaution to guard against secret signals, etc., and that confederacy, fraud, collusion, or similar methods were out of the question.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The eight cases of failure consisted of four cases in which Mr Smith received no impression, and therefore could not reproduce the drawing; and four cases in which the drawing was so vague and imperfect as to be called a total failure.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Some of the figures were grotesque, unusual, and complicated, but all were reproduced in a more or less perfect manner.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The drawing was made deliberately and without hesitation, and as if Smith had actually seen the figure shown to the Transmitter a few moments before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On one occasion, in order to be doubly guarded against collusion, they closed Mr Smith's ears with putty, tied a bandage around his eyes and ears, pulled a bolster-case over his head, and then covered him all over with a blanket which completely enveloped his body and head.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"_And under these extraordinary conditions he reproduced the figures with his usual success._ We could proceed relating case after case, experiment after experiment, conducted by these scientific bodies of learned and careful men.",1,1,0,1,1,0

"In other words, instead of the performer receiving his mental impressions from the mind of the Transmitter, over the nervous system of other persons, he would push up against him, and by a clever system of pushing, pulling, leading, and leaning would detect the muscular movements of the Transmitter, and by careful practice would learn to interpret these movements so as to get an indication of the location of the hidden objects and practically be led or pushed toward the spot.",1,0,0,0,0,0

GENERAL REMARKS ON PRACTICE.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The above exercises will train the student to receive and act upon the mental commands or messages of the Transmitter, under a great variety of circumstances and conditions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Many of the most successful public Mind Readers started out in public work with far less careful and thorough training.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there are now still greater degrees of proficiency possible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The student will find in succeeding chapters a number of interesting and startling feats and experiments which are intended for parlor audiences, etc., but which may be most profitably practiced previously with the aid of a good friendly Transmitter, in order that the Performer may familiarize himself with the details of the experiment, and thus be more at his ease when he demonstrates it in public.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Then other new experiments and feats will suggest themselves from time to time, to the intelligent student which, likewise, should be practiced previous to a public demonstration.",1,0,0,0,0,0

PREPARING FOR PUBLIC WORK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Before taking you on with the work before an audience, we must urge upon you to prepare yourself thoroughly by means of the above mentioned exercises.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The great tendency among students is to hurry through to the public work, and skipping the exercises as much as possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This is all wrong.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You will never be a thoroughly good demonstrator of anything in life, until you master the rudiments, and by practice familiarize yourself thoroughly with the details of the work.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And Mind Reading is no exception.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is true that after a few exercises you may be able to give a fair demonstration before an audience, but you will never get further than fair without careful practice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And therefore we urge you to have patience and perseverance, and to stick to the exercise until you become a Master of Mind Reading, when you need fear no audience whatsoever, and will be able to give a demonstration that will be a great credit to both yourself and to us, your instructors.",1,0,0,0,0,0

LESSON V. SIMPLE DEMONSTRATIONS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In beginning a public demonstration, it will be well for you to give a short preliminary talk to the audience, somewhat along the following lines: OPENING TALK.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"In these demonstrations, I must have your co-operation, for the success of the experiments depends as much upon you as upon myself.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the first place, I must ask that you refrain from conversation, laughter, etc., while I am demonstrating, for these things distract the mind of the Transmitter and prevent him from concentrating his Mind and Will upon mine; and also prevent me from maintaining that Passive Mental State which is essential to the success of the experiments.",1,1,1,1,1,1
I trust that you will help me in this way.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"I also ask that during the experiments, you will all concentrate your Mind and Will upon me, and help me in the work.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In order to obtain the best results all Mind Readers prefer that their audiences concentrate their Wills upon the work, with the purpose of mentally willing that the demonstrator be successful.",1,0,0,0,0,0

INSTRUCTING THE TRANSMITTER.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You should instruct the Transmitter, along the lines indicated in a previous chapter, i.e.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"that he must hold the thought of _direction_, fix his eyes on the chosen spot and then _concentrate his will_ upon it, and that your success will depend materially upon _his ability to concentrate his Mind and Will upon the task_.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"You should explain to him that you receive your impulses through his thought-waves or vibrations, and that the stronger these are, the better you will succeed.",1,1,0,1,1,0
Make this plain to him.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When the Transmitter fails to concentrate his Will, you will know it at once, and should call his attention to it, saying Concentrate, concentrate now--_harder_--use your _Will_, or words to that effect.",1,0,0,0,0,0
You should impress upon the Transmitter that it is the _strength of his Will_ that produces the mental vibrations that give you the impressions.,1,1,1,1,1,1
BEGINNING THE TEST.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then, take the hand of the Transmitter, in the manner already described in previous lesson, placing it to your forehead, or else holding it up high in front of you.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Then begin a wavering motion, or direction, preferably describing a circle, slowly.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In this meaningless wavering motion remain perfectly passive awaiting impressions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Soon you will begin to feel a mental resistance to certain directions, and a mental willingness that you move in another direction.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Then move along the line of the least mental resistance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In some cases you will receive a strong _mental urge_, _pull_, or _push_, in the direction of the selected spot.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Here is where your practice comes in, for in your practice experiments you have acquired the art of recognizing these impressions as they come to you, in their different forms, and so are prepared to yield to them and move accordingly.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is impossible to describe in writing just how these impressions come, and feel like, for actual experience is necessary before you will know just what is meant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But once you have accustomed yourself to receive and recognize the impressions, the rest is all a matter of practice and development.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And now for the demonstrations themselves.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"You should begin with the simplest feats, and then work up gradually to the more complicated and difficult ones.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This plan will build up your own powers, and will develop the Transmitter's.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We herewith give a number of interesting feats and demonstrations, explaining the details of each.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course, the general directions we have given regarding the receiving of impressions, etc., will apply to all of these feats, for the principle underlying them all is the same, precisely.",1,0,0,0,0,0
FINDING A LOCATION.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Find the general location of the person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then standing still, reach out your right hand, and begin feeling about.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You will find that as your hand moves away from the right person you will feel a _drawing back_ impression, whereas when you reach toward the person you will receive an _urging forward_ impression.",1,0,0,0,0,0
A little practice will soon enable you to distinguish these mental impressions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then place your hand on the person who seems to be the centre of the impressions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If this is the wrong person, you will receive a mental impression of _Wrong_; in which case you must start up the moving your hand to and fro, and around, until you feel the urge impression, when you should place your hand on the person immediately in front of you.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you reach the right person, you will receive an unmistakable impression and mental message of All Right, followed by a lessening of the Will tension, and you will know that you have succeeded.",1,0,0,0,0,0
You should practice this in private before attempting public demonstration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
FINDING A SMALL OBJECT.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Have the audience select some small object in plain sight in the room.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Then find it in the manner described of above in the case of the selected person.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The rule is identically the same.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there are some other details to be observed, in the matter of up or down, for the object may be higher than your shoulder or lower, in which case you will have to either reach up or down.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In this reaching up or down, follow the same general rule as given.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When you reach the right location, you will feel an impression of not yet finished from the mind of the Transmitter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Then reach up slowly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If this is right you will receive a corresponding impression, and may go on to centre the object.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if it is not right, you will receive a mental urge _downward_, which you should follow.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The rule always is to _follow the line of the least mental resistance_.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You will always receive the resistance when you are not succeeding, and will always receive the lack of resistance when you are succeeding.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Learn to focus these impressions until they centre positively and constantly on the same spot--_then you have succeeded_, for there will be your object right under your hand.",1,0,0,0,0,0
FINDING A BOOK.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Have the audience select a book on the shelves of a book case, and then find it in the manner just related.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"The three persons should then take their seats, and when you enter the room, and take the hand of your Transmitter, you must first find the Parson; then the Groom; and then the Bride, and arrange them in their proper positions.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a highly effective test, and invariably brings hearty applause, and the hunt affords much merriment to the audience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, as you will see readily, it is but a variation of Demonstration II.",0,0,0,0,0,0
THE HIDDEN JEWELRY.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Have the audience select some small article, like a scarf-pin, ring, etc., and hide it on the person of some one of the audience.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Then you are to find it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"This demonstration combines the features of Demonstration II, and Demonstration III, that is you have first to find the person, as described in Demonstration II, and then the object which is practically a variation of Demonstration III.",1,0,0,0,0,0

REPLACING THE PIN.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is called Replacing the Pin, and is very effective when properly performed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Have a member of the audience take a pin and insert it in the wall in a spot plainly visible to the audience, not too high up, however--about on the level of your shoulder is best.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Then have him withdraw the pin and hide it somewhere in the room.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Then when you return to the room, and take the Transmitter's hand, you should first find the pin, (in the manner heretofore described) and then find the place where it had been stuck; then circling your hand around in narrowing circles until you feel the proper impression push the pin home in the spot in which it formerly was driven.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This final effort is really merely a modification of finding the spot, and with a little practice may be easily performed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
THE THEFT DETECTED.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This feat is called The Theft.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Have one of the audience play the thief, and steal an article of jewelry, or similar small object from a second person called the victim.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Then the thief should hide his spoil in a safe place about the room.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Returning you first find the thief; then the hidden article; then the person, according to the methods already given.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a very effective feat, but is merely a combination of Finding the Person, and Finding an Object.",0,0,0,0,0,0
THE RECONSTRUCTED TABLEAU.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This feat is known as the Reconstructed Tableau.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is performed by having several of the audience form a simple tableau group, and then retire to their seats.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Returning to the room you are to find each person; lead him or her to the former spot; then reconstruct the group.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"This is somewhat difficult, but not nearly so much so as you might suppose.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A little private practice will enable you to perform it with ease.,1,0,0,0,0,0
THE MURDER AND THE DETECTIVE.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This test is known as the Murder and the Detective, and is very spectacular and sensational, and is accordingly one that is in great favor with the public performers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is performed as follows: The audience selects one man to act as the murderer; another to act as the victim; and also some object to act as the dagger; and lastly a place in which the body is to be concealed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Then the murderer picks up the dagger, and kills his victim, afterward concealing the body in some part of the room (usually sitting in a chair) and the dagger in another place.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Then when you return to the room you first find the body; then the wound; then the dagger, and then the murderer.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is usually announced as a wonderful piece of telepathic detective work, and is extremely effective, and may be reserved as the principal effect of your series of demonstrations.",0,0,0,0,0,0

THE RETURNED HATS.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Have the hats of a number of men in the audience placed on a table or other place, and then returning to the room, blindfolded of course, you pick up the hats, one by one, and place them upon the heads of their proper owners, who are seated in different parts of the room.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This is a simple feat although very effective.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is, of course, merely a variation of the feat of finding the person.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is one point, however, that must be remembered in this feat, and that is that the Transmitter should know just whose hat is held in your hand--just who the owner of that particular hat is and where he is sitting or standing.",1,1,1,1,1,1
Otherwise he cannot send you the mental impulses which will enable you to find the owner.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"It will be well for the Transmitter to hold the hat so that it can be seen by the audience, requesting the owner to rise in his seat so as to indicate his whereabouts--your back being turned to the audience while this is being done in order to avoid suspicion of your peeping, etc.",1,0,0,0,0,0
THE LADY AND THE RING.,1,0,0,0,0,0
This feat is performed by having a lady in the audience loan the Transmitter her ring.,1,1,1,1,0,0
"When you return to the room, you find the lady and replace the ring upon the finger from which she took it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The Transmitter must remember the lady, and the particular finger, of course--the rest is simply a combination of the finding the person and finding the spot feats.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is very effective, if neatly performed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We have given you a great variety of Demonstrations or Feats, but you must not attempt to produce all of them at an evening's entertainment.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It will take some time to perform a few of them effectively, and impressively, and you should avoid any attempt to hurry through the feats.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nor should you spoil your good impression by cheapening the demonstrations in the direction of performing too many at one sitting.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Neither should you tire or fatigue yourself by too many feats.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When your mind or body are tired, you do yourself an injury to perform these demonstrations, and besides, you cannot obtain the best results while fatigued.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"You should rest a little while after each feat, before attempting another one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When the entertainment, or exercises are over, you should take a few strong deep breaths, swing your arm around a little to promote the circulation, and relieve the nervous tension.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You may feel a little dazed at first after performing a few feats, but will soon learn to throw off the passive condition, and engage in the laughing conversation that will follow the entertainment.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"If your Transmitter does not do his work properly, and you feel that he is not Concentrating properly, or using his Will effectively, do not hesitate to change him.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"You need not offend him, for you may say simply that the rapport conditions are not fully developed between you, and that these things sometimes happen, etc.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your new Transmitter will feel anxious to do better than his predecessor, and will be most likely to Concentrate and Will to the best of his ability.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The Transmitter should be in earnest, and no levity or trifling should be permitted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you have the selection, pick out some earnest person, and avoid the trifling, feather-brained class.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If your Transmitter does not seem to be Concentrating properly, you should speak to him firmly, but kindly, about it.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Say to him: Please _concentrate_ your _Mind_, and _Will_ earnestly--fix your Mind on the right _Spot_--make a determined Mental Effort that I move in the right direction--it is your Mind and Will that gives me the impression, remember--it all depends upon you, etc.",1,0,0,0,0,0

A WORD OF WARNING.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Beginning your entertainment, caution the audience about placing the hidden objects in places that you cannot conveniently touch--such as high up on the wall; under the strings of a piano, etc.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Some Smart Alicks may try to play pranks on you in this way, but discourage same vigorously at the start, informing the audience that this is a scientific test and not a circus.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And, remember this, tell them that the article must never be hidden about the Transmitter, for the reason that he is seldom able to think as intently about his own location as about some place away from him.",1,1,0,1,1,0
These are the only restrictions that you need make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Caution the Transmitter to guide you away from obstacles over which you might stumble, or which you might overturn.",0,0,0,0,0,0

THE WIRE CONTACT.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A sensational and effective method of performing some of the simpler feats is performed by some public performers, and consists in having a piece of thick wire, about one foot in length grasped by the Receiver's left hand, and by the Transmitter's right hand, instead of the ordinary contact.",1,0,0,0,0,0
A little practice will surprise you in the facility in which the impressions are transferred over the wire from the Transmitter to the Receiver.,1,0,0,0,0,0
The methods of operation in this case are identical with those employed in the ordinary methods.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A wooden ruler may be substituted for the wire.,0,0,0,0,0,0

THIRD PERSON INTERPOSED.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"Practice along these lines will enable the skilled Mind Reader to receive the impressions as usual, notwithstanding the interposition of the third person.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Do not attempt to try these variations until you have thoroughly mastered the ordinary methods.,0,0,0,0,0,0

DISCOVERING THE CARD.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Spread a number of cards over the table.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You will find that after a bit of practice you will be able to get the heavy feeling when you lift up and weigh the right card.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You should perform this feat slowly, and carefully, shaking your head, No, just before you discard a card.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If by the lack of concentration of the Transmitter, you fail to feel the heavy feeling when you pick up the right card, the shake of the head will be apt to arouse him to exert his _Will_ more actively, and you will receive the hold on impulse immediately.",1,1,1,1,1,1

"This method is not nearly so good so far as appearances go, for some critical members of the audience might object that he was in confederacy with you and really helping you to draw--but it is highly effective so far as simplifying the feat is concerned.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"His finger-tips with their nervous matter aroused into activity seem to fairly charge your fingers with nervous energy, or magnetism, and your hand acts almost automatically.",1,0,0,0,0,0

It consists in the performer opening the combination safe of a hotel or some business establishment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In this case the Transmitter must know the combination perfectly, and his mental impressions acting upon the performer give him the cue to turn right or left or repeat as the case may be.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Another way of conducting experiments along the lines of the Higher Phenomena of Mind Reading, is akin to the Automatic Writing known to all students of Occultism.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The Transmitter concentrates his thought and Will in the usual manner, while the Receiver places himself in the usual receptive, passive state of mind, and awaits the impressions.",1,1,1,1,1,1
