-- EARLY FORMS OF LIABILITY.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[1] The object of this book is to present a general view of the Common Law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To accomplish the task, other tools are needed besides logic.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is something to show that the consistency of a system requires a particular result, but it is not all.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, intuitions of public policy, avowed or unconscious, even the prejudices which judges share with their fellow-men, have had a good deal more to do than the syllogism in determining the rules by which men should be governed.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The law embodies the story of a nation's development through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of mathematics.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In order to know what it is, we must know what it has been, and what it tends to become.",1,0,0,0,0,0
We must alternately consult history and existing theories of legislation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the most difficult labor will be to understand the combination of the two into new products at every stage.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The substance of the law at any given time pretty nearly [2] corresponds, so far as it goes, with what is then understood to be convenient; but its form and machinery, and the degree to which it is able to work out desired results, depend very much upon its past.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In Massachusetts today, while, on the one hand, there are a great many rules which are quite sufficiently accounted for by their manifest good sense, on the other, there are some which can only be understood by reference to the infancy of procedure among the German tribes, or to the social condition of Rome under the Decemvirs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I shall use the history of our law so far as it is necessary to explain a conception or to interpret a rule, but no further.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In doing so there are two errors equally to be avoided both by writer and reader.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"One is that of supposing, because an idea seems very familiar and natural to us, that it has always been so.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Many things which we take for granted have had to be laboriously fought out or thought out in past times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The other mistake is the opposite one of asking too much of history.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We start with man full grown.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be assumed that the earliest barbarian whose practices are to be considered, had a good many of the same feelings and passions as ourselves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The first subject to be discussed is the general theory of liability civil and criminal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Common Law has changed a good deal since the beginning of our series of reports, and the search after a theory which may now be said to prevail is very much a study of tendencies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that it will be instructive to go back to the early forms of liability, and to start from them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is commonly known that the early forms of legal procedure were grounded in vengeance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Modern writers [3] have thought that the Roman law started from the blood feud, and all the authorities agree that the German law begun in that way.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The feud led to the composition, at first optional, then compulsory, by which the feud was bought off.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The gradual encroachment of the composition may be traced in the Anglo-Saxon laws, /1/ and the feud was pretty well broken up, though not extinguished, by the time of William the Conqueror.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The killings and house-burnings of an earlier day became the appeals of mayhem and arson.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The appeals de pace et plagis and of mayhem became, or rather were in substance, the action of trespass which is still familiar to lawyers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ But as the compensation recovered in the appeal was the alternative of vengeance, we might expect to find its scope limited to the scope of vengeance.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Vengeance imports a feeling of blame, and an opinion, however distorted by passion, that a wrong has been done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It can hardly go very far beyond the case of a harm intentionally inflicted: even a dog distinguishes between being stumbled over and being kicked.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether for this cause or another, the early English appeals for personal violence seem to have been confined to intentional wrongs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Glanvill /3/ mentions melees, blows, and wounds,--all forms of intentional violence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In the fuller description of such appeals given by Bracton /4/ it is made quite clear that they were based on intentional assaults.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The appeal de pace et plagis laid an intentional assault, described the nature of the arms used, and the length and depth of the wound.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The appellor also had [4] to show that he immediately raised the hue and cry.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when Bracton speaks of the lesser offences, which were not sued by way of appeal, he instances only intentional wrongs, such as blows with the fist, flogging, wounding, insults, and so forth.",1,1,1,0,1,0
/1/ The cause of action in the cases of trespass reported in the earlier Year Books and in the Abbreviatio Plaeitorum is always an intentional wrong.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"It was only at a later day, and after argument, that trespass was extended so as to embrace harms which were foreseen, but which were not the intended consequence of the defendant's act.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ Thence again it extended to unforeseen injuries.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ It will be seen that this order of development is not quite consistent with an opinion which has been held, that it was a characteristic of early law not to penetrate beyond the external visible fact, the damnum corpore corpori datum.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been thought that an inquiry into the internal condition of the defendant, his culpability or innocence, implies a refinement of juridical conception equally foreign to Rome before the Lex Aquilia, and to England when trespass took its shape.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I do not know any very satisfactory evidence that a man was generally held liable either in Rome /4/ or England for the accidental consequences even of his own act.,1,1,1,1,0,0
"But whatever may have been the early law, the foregoing account shows the starting-point of the system with which we have to deal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Our system of private liability for the consequences of a man's own acts, that is, for his trespasses, started from the notion of actual intent and actual personal culpability.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The original principles of liability for harm inflicted by [5] another person or thing have been less carefully considered hitherto than those which governed trespass, and I shall therefore devote the rest of this Lecture to discussing them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I shall try to show that this liability also had its root in the passion of revenge, and to point out the changes by which it reached its present form.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But I shall not confine myself strictly to what is needful for that purpose, because it is not only most interesting to trace the transformation throughout its whole extent, but the story will also afford an instructive example of the mode in which the law has grown, without a break, from barbarism to civilization.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Furthermore, it will throw much light upon some important and peculiar doctrines which cannot be returned to later.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A very common phenomenon, and one very familiar to the student of history, is this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The customs, beliefs, or needs of a primitive time establish a rule or a formula.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the course of centuries the custom, belief, or necessity disappears, but the rule remains.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The reason which gave rise to the rule has been forgotten, and ingenious minds set themselves to inquire how it is to be accounted for.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Some ground of policy is thought of, which seems to explain it and to reconcile it with the present state of things; and then the rule adapts itself to the new reasons which have been found for it, and enters on a new career.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The old form receives a new content, and in time even the form modifies itself to fit the meaning which it has received.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The subject under consideration illustrates this course of events very clearly.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I will begin by taking a medley of examples embodying as many distinct rules, each with its plausible and seemingly sufficient ground of policy to explain it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"[6] A man has an animal of known ferocious habits, which escapes and does his neighbor damage.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"He can prove that the animal escaped through no negligence of his, but still he is held liable.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"It is, says the analytical jurist, because, although he was not negligent at the moment of escape, he was guilty of remote heedlessness, or negligence, or fault, in having such a creature at all.",1,1,1,1,1,1
And one by whose fault damage is done ought to pay for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A baker's man, while driving his master's cart to deliver hot rolls of a morning, runs another man down.",1,1,1,1,1,1
The master has to pay for it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And when he has asked why he should have to pay for the wrongful act of an independent and responsible being, he has been answered from the time of Ulpian to that of Austin, that it is because he was to blame for employing an improper person.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"If he answers, that he used the greatest possible care in choosing his driver, he is told that that is no excuse; and then perhaps the reason is shifted, and it is said that there ought to be a remedy against some one who can pay the damages, or that such wrongful acts as by ordinary human laws are likely to happen in the course of the service are imputable to the service.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Next, take a case where a limit has been set to liability which had previously been unlimited.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In 1851, Congress passed a law, which is still in force, and by which the owners of ships in all the more common cases of maritime loss can surrender the vessel and her freight then pending to the losers; and it is provided that, thereupon, further proceedings against the owners shall cease.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The legislators to whom we owe this act argued that, if a merchant embark a portion of his property upon a hazardous venture, it is reasonable that his stake should be confined to what [7] he puts at risk,--a principle similar to that on which corporations have been so largely created in America during the last fifty years.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"It has been a rule of criminal pleading in England down into the present century, that an indictment for homicide must set forth the value of the instrument causing the death, in order that the king or his grantee might claim forfeiture of the deodand, as an accursed thing, in the language of Blackstone.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"I might go on multiplying examples; but these are enough to show the remoteness of the points to be brought together.--As a first step towards a generalization, it will be necessary to consider what is to be found in ancient and independent systems of law.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"There is a well-known passage in Exodus, /1/ which we shall have to remember later: If an ox gore a man or a woman, that they die: then the ox shall be surely stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be quit.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"When we turn from the Jews to the Greeks, we find the principle of the passage just quoted erected into a system.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Plutarch, in his Solon, tells us that a dog that had bitten a man was to be delivered up bound to a log four cubits long.",1,1,1,1,1,1
Plato made elaborate provisions in his Laws for many such cases.,1,1,1,0,1,0
"If a slave killed a man, he was to be given up to the relatives of the deceased.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"/2/ If he wounded a man, he was to be given up to the injured party to use him as he pleased.",1,1,0,1,0,0
/3/ So if he did damage to which the injured party did not contribute as a joint cause.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In either case, if the owner [8] failed to surrender the slave, he was bound to make good the loss.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"/1/ If a beast killed a man, it was to be slain and cast beyond the borders.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If an inanimate thing caused death, it was to be cast beyond the borders in like manner, and expiation was to be made.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ Nor was all this an ideal creation of merely imagined law, for it was said in one of the speeches of Aeschines, that we banish beyond our borders stocks and stones and steel, voiceless and mindless things, if they chance to kill a man; and if a man commits suicide, bury the hand that struck the blow afar from its body.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is mentioned quite as an every-day matter, evidently without thinking it at all extraordinary, only to point an antithesis to the honors heaped upon Demosthenes.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/3/ As late as the second century after Christ the traveller Pausanias observed with some surprise that they still sat in judgment on inanimate things in the Prytaneum.,0,0,0,0,0,0
/4/ Plutarch attributes the institution to Draco.,1,0,0,0,0,0
/5/ In the Roman law we find the similar principles of the noxoe deditio gradually leading to further results.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Twelve Tables (451 B.C.),0,0,0,0,0,0
"provided that, if an animal had done damage, either the animal was to be surrendered or the damage paid for.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/6/ We learn from Gains that the same rule was applied to the torts of children or slaves, /7/ and there is some trace of it with regard to inanimate things.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The Roman lawyers, not looking beyond their own [9] system or their own time, drew on their wits for an explanation which would show that the law as they found it was reasonable.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Gaius said that it was unjust that the fault of children or slaves should be a source of loss to their parents or owners beyond their own bodies, and Ulpian reasoned that a fortiori this was true of things devoid of life, and therefore incapable of fault.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ This way of approaching the question seems to deal with the right of surrender as if it were a limitation of a liability incurred by a parent or owner, which would naturally and in the first instance be unlimited.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But if that is what was meant, it puts the cart before the horse.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The right of surrender was not introduced as a limitation of liability, but, in Rome and Greece alike, payment was introduced as the alternative of a failure to surrender.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The action was not based, as it would be nowadays, on the fault of the parent or owner.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If it had been, it would always have been brought against the person who had control of the slave or animal at the time it did the harm complained of, and who, if any one, was to blame for not preventing the injury.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"So far from this being the course, the person to be sued was the owner at the time of suing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The action followed the guilty thing into whosesoever hands it came.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ And in curious contrast with the principle as inverted to meet still more modern views of public policy, if the animal was of a wild nature, that is, in the very case of the most ferocious animals, the owner ceased to be liable the moment it escaped, because at that moment he ceased to be owner.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"/3/ There [10] seems to have been no other or more extensive liability by the old law, even where a slave was guilty with his master's knowledge, unless perhaps he was a mere tool in his master's hands.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Gains and Ulpian showed an inclination to cut the noxoe deditio down to a privilege of the owner in case of misdeeds committed without his knowledge; but Ulpian is obliged to admit, that by the ancient law, according to Celsus, the action was noxal where a slave was guilty even with the privity of his master.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ All this shows very clearly that the liability of the owner was merely a way of getting at the slave or animal which was the immediate cause of offence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In other words, vengeance on the immediate offender was the object of the Greek and early Roman process, not indemnity from the master or owner.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The liability of the owner was simply a liability of the offending thing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the primitive customs of Greece it was enforced by a judicial process expressly directed against the object, animate or inanimate.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Roman Twelve Tables made the owner, instead of the thing itself, the defendant, but did not in any way change the ground of liability, or affect its limit.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The change was simply a device to allow the owner to protect his interest.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"/3/ But it may be asked how inanimate objects came to be [11] pursued in this way, if the object of the procedure was to gratify the passion of revenge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Learned men have been ready to find a reason in the personification of inanimate nature common to savages and children, and there is much to confirm this view.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Without such a personification, anger towards lifeless things would have been transitory, at most.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is noticeable that the commonest example in the most primitive customs and laws is that of a tree which falls upon a man, or from which he falls and is killed.",1,1,1,1,0,0
We can conceive with comparative ease how a tree might have been put on the same footing with animals.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It certainly was treated like them, and was delivered to the relatives, or chopped to pieces for the gratification of a real or simulated passion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ In the Athenian process there is also, no doubt, to be traced a different thought.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Expiation is one of the ends most insisted on by Plato, and appears to have been the purpose of the procedure mentioned by Aeschines.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Some passages in the Roman historians which will be mentioned again seem to point in the same direction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ Another peculiarity to be noticed is, that the liability seems to have been regarded as attached to the body doing the damage, in an almost physical sense.",0,0,0,0,0,0
An untrained intelligence only imperfectly performs the analysis by which jurists carry responsibility back to the beginning of a chain of causation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The hatred for anything giving us pain, which wreaks itself on the manifest cause, and which leads even civilized man to kick a door when it pinches his finger, is embodied in the noxoe deditio and [12] other kindred doctrines of early Roman law.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"There is a defective passage in Gaius, which seems to say that liability may sometimes be escaped by giving up even the dead body of the offender.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ So Livy relates that, Brutulus Papins having caused a breach of truce with the Romans, the Samnites determined to surrender him, and that, upon his avoiding disgrace and punishment by suicide, they sent his lifeless body.",1,1,1,0,1,0
"It is noticeable that the surrender seems to be regarded as the natural expiation for the breach of treaty, /2/ and that it is equally a matter of course to send the body when the wrong-doer has perished.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/3/ The most curious examples of this sort occur in the region of what we should now call contract.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Livy again furnishes an example, if, indeed, the last is not one.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Roman Consul Postumius concluded the disgraceful peace of the Caudine Forks (per sponsionem, as Livy says, denying the common story that it was per feedus), and he was sent to Rome to obtain the sanction of the people.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"When there however, he proposed that the persons who had made the [13] contract, including himself, should be given up in satisfaction of it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For, he said, the Roman people not having sanctioned the agreement, who is so ignorant of the jus fetialium as not to know that they are released from obligation by surrendering us?",0,0,0,0,0,0
The formula of surrender seems to bring the case within the noxoe deditio.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Cicero narrates a similar surrender of Mancinus by the pater-patratus to the Numantines, who, however, like the Samnites in the former case, refused to receive him.",1,1,1,0,1,0
/2/ It might be asked what analogy could have been found between a breach of contract and those wrongs which excite the desire for vengeance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it must be remembered that the distinction between tort and breaches of contract, and especially between the remedies for the two, is not found ready made.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is conceivable that a procedure adapted to redress for violence was extended to other cases as they arose.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Slaves were surrendered for theft as well as [14] for assault; /1/ and it is said that a debtor who did not pay his debts, or a seller who failed to deliver an article for which he had been paid, was dealt with on the same footing as a thief.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"/2/ This line of thought, together with the quasi material conception of legal obligations as binding the offending body, which has been noticed, would perhaps explain the well-known law of the Twelve Tables as to insolvent debtors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"According to that law, if a man was indebted to several creditors and insolvent, after certain formalities they might cut up his body and divide it among them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If there was a single creditor, he might put his debtor to death or sell him as a slave.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"/3/ If no other right were given but to reduce a debtor to slavery, the law might be taken to look only to compensation, and to be modelled on the natural working of self-redress.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/4/ The principle of our own law, that taking a man's body on execution satisfies the debt, although he is not detained an hour, seems to be explained in that way.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"But the right to put to death looks like vengeance, and the division of the body shows that the debt was conceived very literally to inhere in or bind the body with a vinculum juris.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Whatever may be the true explanation of surrender in connection with contracts, for the present purpose we need not go further than the common case of noxoe deditio for wrongs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Neither is the seeming adhesion of liability to the very body which did the harm of the first importance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[15] The Roman law dealt mainly with living creatures,--with animals and slaves.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a man was run over, it did not surrender the wagon which crushed him, but the ox which drew the wagon.",1,1,1,1,0,0
/1/ At this stage the notion is easy to understand.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The desire for vengeance may be felt as strongly against a slave as against a freeman, and it is not without example nowadays that a like passion should be felt against an animal.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The surrender of the slave or beast empowered the injured party to do his will upon them.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Payment by the owner was merely a privilege in case he wanted to buy the vengeance off.,1,1,1,1,1,1
It will readily be imagined that such a system as has been described could not last when civilization had advanced to any considerable height.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What had been the privilege of buying off vengeance by agreement, of paying the damage instead of surrendering the body of the offender, no doubt became a general custom.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Aquilian law, passed about a couple of centuries later than the date of the Twelve Tables, enlarged the sphere of compensation for bodily injuries.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Interpretation enlarged the Aquilian law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Masters became personally liable for certain wrongs committed by their slaves with their knowledge, where previously they were only bound to surrender the slave.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ If a pack-mule threw off his burden upon a passer-by because he had been improperly overloaded, or a dog which might have been restrained escaped from his master and bit any one, the old noxal action, as it was called, gave way to an action under the new law to enforce a general personal liability.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"/3/ Still later, ship-owners and innkeepers were made liable [16] as if they were wrong-doers for wrongs committed by those in their employ on board ship or in the tavern, although of course committed without their knowledge.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The true reason for this exceptional responsibility was the exceptional confidence which was necessarily reposed in carriers and innkeepers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ But some of the jurists, who regarded the surrender of children and slaves as a privilege intended to limit liability, explained this new liability on the ground that the innkeeper or ship-owner was to a certain degree guilty of negligence in having employed the services of bad men?",0,0,0,0,0,0
This was the first instance of a master being made unconditionally liable for the wrongs of his servant.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"The reason given for it was of general application, and the principle expanded to the scope of the reason.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The law as to ship-owners and innkeepers introduced another and more startling innovation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It made them responsible when those whom they employed were free, as well as when they were slaves.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ For the first time one man was made answerable for the wrongs of another who was also answerable himself, and who had a standing before the law.",1,1,1,1,0,0
This was a great change from the bare permission to ransom one's slave as a privilege.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But here we have the history of the whole modern doctrine of master and servant, and principal and agent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All servants are now as free and as liable to a suit as their masters.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Yet the principle introduced on special grounds in a special case, when servants were slaves, is now the general law of this country and England, and under it men daily have to pay large sums for other people's acts, in which they had no part and [17] for which they are in no sense to blame.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And to this day the reason offered by the Roman jurists for an exceptional rule is made to justify this universal and unlimited responsibility.,0,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ So much for one of the parents of our common law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now let us turn for a moment to the Teutonic side.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Salic Law embodies usages which in all probability are of too early a date to have been influenced either by Rome or the Old Testament.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The official theory is that each new decision follows syllogistically from existing precedents.,0,0,0,0,0,0

[39] LECTURE II.,0,0,0,0,0,0
-- THE CRIMINAL LAW.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In the beginning of the first Lecture it was shown that the appeals of the early law were directed only to intentional wrongs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The appeal was a far older form of procedure than the indictment, and may be said to have had a criminal as well as a civil aspect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It had the double object of satisfying the private party for his loss, and the king for the breach of his peace.",1,1,0,1,1,0
On its civil side it was rooted in vengeance.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"It was a proceeding to recover those compositions, at first optional, afterwards compulsory, by which a wrong-doer bought the spear from his side.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Whether, so far as concerned the king, it had the same object of vengeance, or was more particularly directed to revenue, does not matter, since the claim of the king did not enlarge the scope of the action.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It would seem to be a fair inference that indictable offences were originally limited in the same way as those which gave rise to an appeal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For whether the indictment arose by a splitting up of the appeal, or in some other way, the two were closely connected.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"An acquittal of the appellee on the merits was a bar to an indictment; and, on the other hand, when an appeal was fairly started, although the appellor might fail to prosecute, or might be defeated by plea, the cause might still be proceeded with on behalf of the king.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ [40] The presentment, which is the other parent of our criminal procedure, had an origin distinct from the appeal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If, as has been thought, it was merely the successor of fresh suit and lynch law, /1/ this also is the child of vengeance, even more clearly than the other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The desire for vengeance imports an opinion that its object is actually and personally to blame.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"It takes an internal standard, not an objective or external one, and condemns its victim by that.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The question is whether such a standard is still accepted either in this primitive form, or in some more refined development, as is commonly supposed, and as seems not impossible, considering the relative slowness with which the criminal law has improved.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It certainly may be argued, with some force, that it has never ceased to be one object of punishment to satisfy the desire for vengeance.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The argument will be made plain by considering those instances in which, for one reason or another, compensation for a wrong is out of the question.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Thus an act may be of such a kind as to make indemnity impossible by putting an end to the principal sufferer, as in the case of murder or manslaughter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, these and other crimes, like forgery, although directed against an individual, tend to make others feel unsafe, and this general insecurity does not admit of being paid for.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, there are cases where there are no means of enforcing indemnity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In Macaulay's draft of the Indian Penal Code, breaches of contract for the carriage of passengers, were made criminal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The palanquin-bearers of India were too poor to pay damages, and yet had to be [41] trusted to carry unprotected women and children through wild and desolate tracts, where their desertion would have placed those under their charge in great danger.",1,0,0,0,0,0
In all these cases punishment remains as an alternative.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A pain can be inflicted upon the wrong-doer, of a sort which does not restore the injured party to his former situation, or to another equally good, but which is inflicted for the very purpose of causing pain.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"And so far as this punishment takes the place of compensation, whether on account of the death of the person to whom the wrong was done, the indefinite number of persons affected, the impossibility of estimating the worth of the suffering in money, or the poverty of the criminal, it may be said that one of its objects is to gratify the desire for vengeance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The prisoner pays with his body.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"The statement may be made stronger still, and it may be said, not only that the law does, but that it ought to, make the gratification of revenge an object.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is the opinion, at any rate, of two authorities so great, and so opposed in other views, as Bishop Butler and Jeremy Bentham.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Sir James Stephen says, The criminal law stands to the passion of revenge in much the same relation as marriage to the sexual appetite.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ The first requirement of a sound body of law is, that it should correspond with the actual feelings and demands of the community, whether right or wrong.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If people would gratify the passion of revenge outside of the law, if the law did not help them, the law has no choice but to satisfy the craving itself, and thus avoid the greater evil of private [42] retribution.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"At the same time, this passion is not one which we encourage, either as private individuals or as lawmakers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Moreover, it does not cover the whole ground.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are crimes which do not excite it, and we should naturally expect that the most important purposes of punishment would be coextensive with the whole field of its application.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It remains to be discovered whether such a general purpose exists, and if so what it is.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Different theories still divide opinion upon the subject.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It has been thought that the purpose of punishment is to reform the criminal; that it is to deter the criminal and others from committing similar crimes; and that it is retribution.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Few would now maintain that the first of these purposes was the only one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it were, every prisoner should be released as soon as it appears clear that he will never repeat his offence, and if he is incurable he should not be punished at all.",1,1,1,1,1,1
Of course it would be hard to reconcile the punishment of death with this doctrine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The main struggle lies between the other two.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the one side is the notion that there is a mystic bond between wrong and punishment; on the other, that the infliction of pain is only a means to an end.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hegel, one of the great expounders of the former view, puts it, in his quasi mathematical form, that, wrong being the negation of right, punishment is the negation of that negation, or retribution.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thus the punishment must be equal, in the sense of proportionate to the crime, because its only function is to destroy it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Others, without this logical apparatus, are content to rely upon a felt necessity that suffering should follow wrong-doing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is objected that the preventive theory is immoral, because it overlooks the ill-desert of wrong-doing, and furnishes [43] no measure of the amount of punishment, except the lawgiver's subjective opinion in regard to the sufficiency of the amount of preventive suffering.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ In the language of Kant, it treats man as a thing, not as a person; as a means, not as an end in himself.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is said to conflict with the sense of justice, and to violate the fundamental principle of all free communities, that the members of such communities have equal rights to life, liberty, and personal security.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ In spite of all this, probably most English-speaking lawyers would accept the preventive theory without hesitation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As to the violation of equal rights which is charged, it may be replied that the dogma of equality makes an equation between individuals only, not between an individual and the community.",0,0,0,0,0,0
No society has ever admitted that it could not sacrifice individual welfare to its own existence.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"If conscripts are necessary for its army, it seizes them, and marches them, with bayonets in their rear, to death.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It runs highways and railroads through old family places in spite of the owner's protest, paying in this instance the market value, to be sure, because no civilized government sacrifices the citizen more than it can help, but still sacrificing his will and his welfare to that of the rest.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"/3/ If it were necessary to trench further upon the field of morals, it might be suggested that the dogma of equality applied even to individuals only within the limits of ordinary dealings in the common run of affairs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You cannot argue with your neighbor, except on the admission for the [44] moment that he is as wise as you, although you may by no means believe it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the same way, you cannot deal with him, where both are free to choose, except on the footing of equal treatment, and the same rules for both.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The ever-growing value set upon peace and the social relations tends to give the law of social being the appearance of the law of all being.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it seems to me clear that the ultima ratio, not only regum, but of private persons, is force, and that at the bottom of all private relations, however tempered by sympathy and all the social feelings, is a justifiable self-preference.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a man is on a plank in the deep sea which will only float one, and a stranger lays hold of it, he will thrust him off if he can.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"When the state finds itself in a similar position, it does the same thing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The considerations which answer the argument of equal rights also answer the objections to treating man as a thing, and the like.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a man lives in society, he is liable to find himself so treated.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"The degree of civilization which a people has reached, no doubt, is marked by their anxiety to do as they would be done by.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be the destiny of man that the social instincts shall grow to control his actions absolutely, even in anti-social situations.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"But they have not yet done so, and as the rules of law are or should be based upon a morality which is generally accepted, no rule founded on a theory of absolute unselfishness can be laid down without a breach between law and working beliefs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it be true, as I shall presently try to show, that the general principles of criminal and civil liability are the same, it will follow from that alone that theory and fact agree in frequently punishing those who have been guilty [45] of no moral wrong, and who could not be condemned by any standard that did not avowedly disregard the personal peculiarities of the individuals concerned.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If punishment stood on the moral grounds which are proposed for it, the first thing to be considered would be those limitations in the capacity for choosing rightly which arise from abnormal instincts, want of education, lack of intelligence, and all the other defects which are most marked in the criminal classes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I do not say that they should not be, or at least I do not need to for my argument.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I do not say that the criminal law does more good than harm.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I only say that it is not enacted or administered on that theory.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There remains to be mentioned the affirmative argument in favor of the theory of retribution, to the effect that the fitness of punishment following wrong-doing is axiomatic, and is instinctively recognized by unperverted minds.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I think that it will be seen, on self-inspection, that this feeling of fitness is absolute and unconditional only in the case of our neighbors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It does not seem to me that any one who has satisfied himself that an act of his was wrong, and that he will never do it again, would feel the least need or propriety, as between himself and an earthly punishing power alone, of his being made to suffer for what he had done, although, when third persons were introduced, he might, as a philosopher, admit the necessity of hurting him to frighten others.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But when our neighbors do wrong, we sometimes feel the fitness of making them smart for it, whether they have repented or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The feeling of fitness seems to me to be only vengeance in disguise, and I have already admitted that vengeance was an element, though not the chief element, of punishment.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"[46] But, again, the supposed intuition of fitness does not seem to me to be coextensive with the thing to be accounted for.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The lesser punishments are just as fit for the lesser crimes as the greater for the greater.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The demand that crime should be followed by its punishment should therefore be equal and absolute in both.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, a malum prohibitum is just as much a crime as a malum in se.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If there is any general ground for punishment, it must apply to one case as much as to the other.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But it will hardly be said that, if the wrong in the case just supposed consisted of a breach of the revenue laws, and the government had been indemnified for the loss, we should feel any internal necessity that a man who had thoroughly repented of his wrong should be punished for it, except on the ground that his act was known to others.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If it was known, the law would have to verify its threats in order that others might believe and tremble.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But if the fact was a secret between the sovereign and the subject, the sovereign, if wholly free from passion, would undoubtedly see that punishment in such a case was wholly without justification.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the other hand, there can be no case in which the law-maker makes certain conduct criminal without his thereby showing a wish and purpose to prevent that conduct.",1,1,1,1,1,1
Prevention would accordingly seem to be the chief and only universal purpose of punishment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The law threatens certain pains if you do certain things, intending thereby to give you a new motive for not doing them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you persist in doing them, it has to inflict the pains in order that its threats may continue to be believed.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If this is a true account of the law as it stands, the law does undoubtedly treat the individual as a means to an [47] end, and uses him as a tool to increase the general welfare at his own expense.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"It has been suggested above, that this course is perfectly proper; but even if it is wrong, our criminal law follows it, and the theory of our criminal law must be shaped accordingly.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Further evidence that our law exceeds the limits of retribution, and subordinates consideration of the individual to that of the public well-being, will be found in some doctrines which cannot be satisfactorily explained on any other ground.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first of these is, that even the deliberate taking of life will not be punished when it is the only way of saving one's own.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This principle is not so clearly established as that next to be mentioned; but it has the support of very great authority.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ If that is the law, it must go on one of two grounds, either that self-preference is proper in the case supposed, or that, even if it is improper, the law cannot prevent it by punishment, because a threat of death at some future time can never be a sufficiently powerful motive to make a man choose death now in order to avoid the threat.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If the former ground is adopted, it admits that a single person may sacrifice another to himself, and a fortiori that a people may.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"If the latter view is taken, by abandoning punishment when it can no longer be expected to prevent an act, the law abandons the retributive and adopts the preventive theory.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The next doctrine leads to still clearer conclusions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Ignorance of the law is no excuse for breaking it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This substantive principle is sometimes put in the form of a rule of evidence, that every one is presumed to know the [48] law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has accordingly been defended by Austin and others, on the ground of difficulty of proof.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If justice requires the fact to be ascertained, the difficulty of doing so is no ground for refusing to try.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But every one must feel that ignorance of the law could never be admitted as an excuse, even if the fact could be proved by sight and hearing in every case.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Furthermore, now that parties can testify, it may be doubted whether a man's knowledge of the law is any harder to investigate than many questions which are gone into.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The difficulty, such as it is, would be met by throwing the burden of proving ignorance on the lawbreaker.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The principle cannot be explained by saying that we are not only commanded to abstain from certain acts, but also to find out that we are commanded.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For if there were such a second command, it is very clear that the guilt of failing to obey it would bear no proportion to that of disobeying the principal command if known, yet the failure to know would receive the same punishment as the failure to obey the principal law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The true explanation of the rule is the same as that which accounts for the law's indifference to a man's particular temperament, faculties, and so forth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Public policy sacrifices the individual to the general good.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is desirable that the burden of all should be equal, but it is still more desirable to put an end to robbery and murder.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is no doubt true that there are many cases in which the criminal could not have known that he was breaking the law, but to admit the excuse at all would be to encourage ignorance where the law-maker has determined to make men know and obey, and justice to the individual is rightly outweighed by the larger interests on the other side of the scales.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"[49] If the foregoing arguments are sound, it is already manifest that liability to punishment cannot be finally and absolutely determined by considering the actual personal unworthiness of the criminal alone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That consideration will govern only so far as the public welfare permits or demands.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And if we take into account the general result which the criminal law is intended to bring about, we shall see that the actual state of mind accompanying a criminal act plays a different part from what is commonly supposed.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For the most part, the purpose of the criminal law is only to induce external conformity to rule.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All law is directed to conditions of things manifest to the senses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And whether it brings those conditions to pass immediately by the use of force, as when it protects a house from a mob by soldiers, or appropriates private property to public use, or hangs a man in pursuance of a judicial sentence, or whether it brings them about mediately through men's fears, its object is equally an external result.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In directing itself against robbery or murder, for instance, its purpose is to put a stop to the actual physical taking and keeping of other men's goods, or the actual poisoning, shooting, stabbing, and otherwise putting to death of other men.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If those things are not done, the law forbidding them is equally satisfied, whatever the motive.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Considering this purely external purpose of the law together with the fact that it is ready to sacrifice the individual so far as necessary in order to accomplish that purpose, we can see more readily than before that the actual degree of personal guilt involved in any particular transgression cannot be the only element, if it is an element at all, in the liability incurred.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"So far from its [50] being true, as is often assumed, that the condition of a man's heart or conscience ought to be more considered in determining criminal than civil liability, it might almost be said that it is the very opposite of truth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For civil liability, in its immediate working, is simply a redistribution of an existing loss between two individuals; and it will be argued in the next Lecture that sound policy lets losses lie where they fall, except where a special reason can be shown for interference.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The most frequent of such reasons is, that the party who is charged has been to blame.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is not intended to deny that criminal liability, as well as civil, is founded on blameworthiness.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Such a denial would shock the moral sense of any civilized community; or, to put it another way, a law which punished conduct which would not be blameworthy in the average member of the community would be too severe for that community to bear.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is only intended to point out that, when we are dealing with that part of the law which aims more directly than any other at establishing standards of conduct, we should expect there more than elsewhere to find that the tests of liability are external, and independent of the degree of evil in the particular person's motives or intentions.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The conclusion follows directly from the nature of the standards to which conformity is required.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are not only external, as was shown above, but they are of general application.",1,0,0,0,0,0
They do not merely require that every man should get as near as he can to the best conduct possible for him.,1,1,1,1,0,0
They require him at his own peril to come up to a certain height.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"They take no account of incapacities, unless the weakness is so marked as to fall into well-known exceptions, such as infancy or madness.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[51] They assume that every man is as able as every other to behave as they command.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"If they fall on any one class harder than on another, it is on the weakest.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For it is precisely to those who are most likely to err by temperament, ignorance, or folly, that the threats of the law are the most dangerous.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The reconciliation of the doctrine that liability is founded on blameworthiness with the existence of liability where the party is not to blame, will be worked out more fully in the next Lecture.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is found in the conception of the average man, the man of ordinary intelligence and reasonable prudence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Liability is said to arise out of such conduct as would be blameworthy in him.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"But he is an ideal being, represented by the jury when they are appealed to, and his conduct is an external or objective standard when applied to any given individual.",1,1,0,1,1,0

"The next step is to take up some crimes in detail, and to discover what analysis will teach with regard to them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I will begin with murder.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Murder is defined by Sir James Stephen, in his Digest of Criminal Law, /1/ as unlawful homicide with malice aforethought.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"In his earlier work, /2/ he explained that malice meant wickedness, and that the law had determined what states of mind were wicked in the necessary degree.",1,1,0,1,1,0
Without the same preliminary he continues in his Digest as follows:-- [52] Malice aforethought means any one or more of the following states of mind.....,1,1,0,1,1,0
"An intention to cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, any person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not; (b.)",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Knowledge that the act which causes death will probably cause the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, some person, whether such person is the person actually killed or not, although such knowledge is accompanied by indifference whether death or grievous bodily harm is caused or not, or by a wish that it may not be caused; (c.) An intent to commit any felony whatever; (d.) An intent to oppose by force any officer of justice on his way to, in, or returning from the execution of the duty of arresting, keeping in custody, or imprisoning any person whom he is lawfully entitled to arrest, keep in custody, or imprison, or the duty of keeping the peace or dispersing an unlawful assembly, provided that the offender has notice that the person killed is such an officer so employed.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Malice, as used in common speech, includes intent, and something more.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When an act is said to be done with an intent to do harm, it is meant that a wish for the harm is the motive of the act.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Intent, however, is perfectly consistent with the harm being regretted as such, and being wished only as a means to something else.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when an act is said to be done maliciously, it is meant, not only that a wish for the harmful effect is the motive, but also that the harm is wished for its own sake, or, as Austin would say with more accuracy, for the sake of the pleasurable feeling which knowledge of the suffering caused by the act would excite.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Now it is apparent from Sir James [53] Stephen's enumeration, that of these two elements of malice the intent alone is material to murder.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is just as much murder to shoot a sentry for the purpose of releasing a friend, as to shoot him because you hate him.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Malice, in the definition of murder, has not the same meaning as in common speech, and, in view of the considerations just mentioned, it has been thought to mean criminal intention.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ But intent again will be found to resolve itself into two things; foresight that certain consequences will follow from an act, and the wish for those consequences working as a motive which induces the act.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The question then is, whether intent, in its turn, cannot be reduced to a lower term.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sir James Stephen's statement shows that it can be, and that knowledge that the act will probably cause death, that is, foresight of the consequences of the act, is enough in murder as in tort.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, a newly born child is laid naked out of doors, where it must perish as a matter of course.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is none the less murder, that the guilty party would have been very glad to have a stranger find the child and save it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ But again, What is foresight of consequences?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a picture of a future state of things called up by knowledge of the present state of things, the future being viewed as standing to the present in the relation of effect to cause.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, we must seek a reduction to lower terms.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the known present state of things is such that the act done will very certainly cause death, and the probability is a matter of common knowledge, one who does the act, [54] knowing the present state of things, is guilty of murder, and the law will not inquire whether he did actually foresee the consequences or not.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The test of foresight is not what this very criminal foresaw, but what a man of reasonable prudence would have foreseen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the other hand, there must be actual present knowledge of the present facts which make an act dangerous.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The act is not enough by itself.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"An act, it is true, imports intention in a certain sense.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a muscular contraction, and something more.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A spasm is not an act.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The contraction of the muscles must be willed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as an adult who is master of himself foresees with mysterious accuracy the outward adjustment which will follow his inward effort, that adjustment may be said to be intended.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But the intent necessarily accompanying the act ends there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Nothing would follow from the act except for the environment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"All acts, taken apart from their surrounding circumstances, are indifferent to the law.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, to crook the forefinger with a certain force is the same act whether the trigger of a pistol is next to it or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is only the surrounding circumstances of a pistol loaded and cocked, and of a human being in such relation to it, as to be manifestly likely to be hit, that make the act a wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence, it is no sufficient foundation for liability, on any sound principle, that the proximate cause of loss was an act.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The reason for requiring an act is, that an act implies a choice, and that it is felt to be impolitic and unjust to make a man answerable for harm, unless he might have chosen otherwise.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"But the choice must be made with a chance of contemplating the consequence complained of, or else it has no bearing on responsibility for that consequence.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"[55] If this were not true, a man might be held answerable for everything which would not have happened but for his choice at some past time.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"For instance, for having in a fit fallen on a man, which he would not have done had he not chosen to come to the city where he was taken ill. All foresight of the future, all choice with regard to any possible consequence of action, depends on what is known at the moment of choosing.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"An act cannot be wrong, even when done under circumstances in which it will be hurtful, unless those circumstances are or ought to be known.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"A fear of punishment for causing harm cannot work as a motive, unless the possibility of harm may be foreseen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So far, then, as criminal liability is founded upon wrong-doing in any sense, and so far as the threats and punishments of the law are intended to deter men from bringing about various harmful results, they must be confined to cases where circumstances making the conduct dangerous were known.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Still, in a more limited way, the same principle applies to knowledge that applies to foresight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is enough that such circumstances were actually known as would have led a man of common understanding to infer from them the rest of the group making up the present state of things.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, if a workman on a house-top at mid-day knows that the space below him is a street in a great city, he knows facts from which a man of common understanding would infer that there were people passing below.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"He is therefore bound to draw that inference, or, in other words, is chargeable with knowledge of that fact also, whether he draws the inference or not.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"If then, he throws down a heavy beam into the street, he does an act [56] which a person of ordinary prudence would foresee is likely to cause death, or grievous bodily harm, and he is dealt with as if he foresaw it, whether he does so in fact or not.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"If a death is caused by the act, he is guilty of murder.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"/1/ But if the workman has reasonable cause to believe that the space below is a private yard from which every one is excluded, and which is used as a rubbish heap, his act is not blameworthy, and the homicide is a mere misadventure.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To make an act which causes death murder, then, the actor ought, on principle, to know, or have notice of the facts which make the act dangerous.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are certain exceptions to this principle which will be stated presently, but they have less application to murder than to some smaller statutory crimes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The general rule prevails for the most part in murder.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But furthermore, on the same principle, the danger which in fact exists under the known circumstances ought to be of a class which a man of reasonable prudence could foresee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Ignorance of a fact and inability to foresee a consequence have the same effect on blameworthiness.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a consequence cannot be foreseen, it cannot be avoided.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But there is this practical difference, that whereas, in most cases, the question of knowledge is a question of the actual condition of the defendant's consciousness, the question of what he might have foreseen is determined by the standard of the prudent man, that is, by general experience.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"For it is to be remembered that the object of the law is to prevent human life being endangered or taken; and that, although it so far considers blameworthiness in punishing as not to hold a man responsible for consequences which [57] no one, or only some exceptional specialist, could have foreseen, still the reason for this limitation is simply to make a rule which is not too hard for the average member of the community.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As the purpose is to compel men to abstain from dangerous conduct, and not merely to restrain them from evil inclinations, the law requires them at their peril to know the teachings of common experience, just as it requires them to know the law.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Subject to these explanations, it may be said that the test of murder is the degree of danger to life attending the act under the known circumstances of the case.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ It needs no further explanation to show that, when the particular defendant does for any reason foresee what an ordinary man of reasonable prudence would not have foreseen, the ground of exemption no longer applies.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A harmful act is only excused on the ground that the party neither did foresee, nor could with proper care have foreseen harm.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would seem, at first sight, that the above analysis ought to exhaust the whole subject of murder.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it does not without some further explanation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a man forcibly resists an officer lawfully making an arrest, and kills him, knowing him to be an officer, it may be murder, although no act is done which, but for his official function, would be criminal at all.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"So, if a man does an act with intent to commit a felony, and thereby accidentally kills another; for instance, if he fires at chickens, intending to steal them, and accidentally kills the owner, whom he does not see.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Such a case as this last seems hardly to be reconcilable with the general principles which have been laid down.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been argued somewhat as [58] follows:--The only blameworthy act is firing at the chickens, knowing them to belong to another.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is neither more nor less so because an accident happens afterwards; and hitting a man, whose presence could not have been suspected, is an accident.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The fact that the shooting is felonious does not make it any more likely to kill people.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"If the object of the rule is to prevent such accidents, it should make accidental killing with firearms murder, not accidental killing in the effort to steal; while, if its object is to prevent stealing, it would do better to hang one thief in every thousand by lot.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Still, the law is intelligible as it stands.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The general test of murder is the degree of danger attending the acts under the known state of facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If certain acts are regarded as peculiarly dangerous under certain circumstances, a legislator may make them punishable if done under these circumstances, although the danger was not generally known.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The law often takes this step, although it does not nowadays often inflict death in such cases.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It sometimes goes even further, and requires a man to find out present facts, as well as to foresee future harm, at his peril, although they are not such as would necessarily be inferred from the facts known.",1,1,1,1,0,0
Thus it is a statutory offence in England to abduct a girl under sixteen from the possession of the person having lawful charge of her.,1,1,1,1,0,0
"If a man does acts which induce a girl under sixteen to leave her parents, he is not chargeable, if he had no reason to know that she was under the lawful charge of her parents, /1/ and it may be presumed that he would not be, if he had reasonable cause to believe that she was a boy.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But if he knowingly abducts a girl from [59] her parents, he must find out her age at his peril.",1,1,0,1,0,0
It is no defence that he had every reason to think her over sixteen.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ So, under a prohibitory liquor law, it has been held that, if a man sells Plantation Bitters, it is no defence that he does not know them to be intoxicating.",1,1,1,1,0,0
/2/ And there are other examples of the same kind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, if experience shows, or is deemed by the law-maker to show, that somehow or other deaths which the evidence makes accidental happen disproportionately often in connection with other felonies, or with resistance to officers, or if on any other ground of policy it is deemed desirable to make special efforts for the prevention of such deaths, the lawmaker may consistently treat acts which, under the known circumstances, are felonious, or constitute resistance to officers, as having a sufficiently dangerous tendency to be put under a special ban.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The law may, therefore, throw on the actor the peril, not only of the consequences foreseen by him, but also of consequences which, although not predicted by common experience, the legislator apprehends.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"I do not, however, mean to argue that the rules under discussion arose on the above reasoning, any more than that they are right, or would be generally applied in this country.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Returning to the main line of thought it will be instructive to consider the relation of manslaughter to murder.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One great difference between the two will be found to lie in the degree of danger attaching to the act in the given state of facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a man strikes another with a small stick which is not likely to kill, and which he has no reason to suppose will do more than slight bodily harm, but which [60] does kill the other, he commits manslaughter, not murder.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"/1/ But if the blow is struck as hard as possible with an iron bar an inch thick, it is murder.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ So if, at the time of striking with a switch, the party knows an additional fact, by reason of which he foresees that death will be the consequence of a slight blow, as, for instance, that the other has heart disease, the offence is equally murder.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ To explode a barrel of gunpowder in a crowded street, and kill people, is murder, although the actor hopes that no such harm will be done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/4/ But to kill a man by careless riding in the same street would commonly be manslaughter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/5/ Perhaps, however, a case could be put where the riding was so manifestly dangerous that it would be murder.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To recur to an example which has been used already for another purpose: When a workman flings down a stone or piece of timber into the street, and kills a man; this may be either misadventure, manslaughter, or murder, according to the circumstances under which the original act was done: if it were in a country village, where few passengers are, and he calls out to all people to have a care, it is misadventure only; but if it were in London, or other populous town, where people are continually passing, it is manslaughter, though he gives loud warning; and murder, if he knows of their passing, and gives no warning at all.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/6/ The law of manslaughter contains another doctrine [61] which should be referred to in order to complete the understanding of the general principles of the criminal law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This doctrine is, that provocation may reduce an offence which would otherwise have been murder to manslaughter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"According to current morality, a man is not so much to blame for an act done under the disturbance of great excitement, caused by a wrong done to himself, as when he is calm.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"The law is made to govern men through their motives, and it must, therefore, take their mental constitution into account.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It might be urged, on the other side, that, if the object of punishment is prevention, the heaviest punishment should be threatened where the strongest motive is needed to restrain; and primitive legislation seems sometimes to have gone on that principle.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if any threat will restrain a man in a passion, a threat of less than death will be sufficient, and therefore the extreme penalty has been thought excessive.",0,0,0,0,0,0
At the same time the objective nature of legal standards is shown even here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The mitigation does not come from the fact that the defendant was beside himself with rage.,1,1,1,1,1,1
It is not enough that he had grounds which would have had the same effect on every man of his standing and education.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"The most insulting words are not provocation, although to this day, and still more when the law was established, many people would rather die than suffer them without action.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"There must be provocation sufficient to justify the passion, and the law decides on general considerations what provocations are sufficient.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is said that even what the law admits to be provocation does not extenuate the guilt of homicide, unless the person provoked is at the time when he does the deed [62] deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation which he has received.",1,1,1,1,1,1
/1/ There are obvious reasons for taking the actual state of the defendant's consciousness into account to this extent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The only ground for not applying the general rule is, that the defendant was in such a state that he could not be expected to remember or be influenced by the fear of punishment; if he could be, the ground of exception disappears.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Yet even here, rightly or wrongly, the law has gone far in the direction of adopting external tests.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The courts seem to have decided between murder and manslaughter on such grounds as the nature of the weapon used, /2/ or the length of time between the provocation and the act.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/3/ But in other cases the question whether the prisoner was deprived of self-control by passion has been left to the jury.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/4/ As the object of this Lecture is not to give an outline of the criminal law, but to explain its general theory, I shall only consider such offences as throw some special light upon the subject, and shall treat of those in such order as seems best fitted for that purpose.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It will now be useful to take up malicious mischief, and to compare the malice required to constitute that offence with the malice aforethought of murder.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The charge of malice aforethought in an indictment for murder has been shown not to mean a state of the defendant's mind, as is often thought, except in the sense that he knew circumstances which did in fact make his conduct dangerous.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"It is, in truth, an allegation like that of negligence, which asserts that the party accused did not [63] come up to the legal standard of action under the circumstances in which he found himself, and also that there was no exceptional fact or excuse present which took the case out of the general rule.",1,1,0,1,1,0
It is an averment of a conclusion of law which is permitted to abridge the facts (positive and negative) on which it is founded.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"When a statute punishes the wilfully and maliciously injuring another's property, it is arguable, if not clear, that something more is meant.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The presumption that the second word was not added without some meaning is seconded by the unreasonableness of making every wilful trespass criminal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ If this reasoning prevails, maliciously is here used in its popular sense, and imports that the motive for the defendant's act was a wish to harm the owner of the property, or the thing itself, if living, as an end, and for the sake of the harm.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Malice in this sense has nothing in common with the malice of murder.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Statutory law need not profess to be consistent with itself, or with the theory adopted by judicial decisions.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Hence there is strictly no need to reconcile such a statute with the principles which have been explained.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there is no inconsistency.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Although punishment must be confined to compelling external conformity to a rule of conduct, so far that it can always be avoided by avoiding or doing certain acts as required, with whatever intent or for whatever motive, still the prohibited conduct may not be hurtful unless it is accompanied by a particular state of feeling.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Common disputes about property are satisfactorily settled by compensation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But every one knows that sometimes secret harm is done by neighbor to neighbor out of [64] pure malice and spite.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The damage can be paid for, but the malignity calls for revenge, and the difficulty of detecting the authors of such wrongs, which are always done secretly, affords a ground for punishment, even if revenge is thought insufficient.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How far the law will go in this direction it is hard to say.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The crime of arson is defined to be the malicious and wilful burning of the house of another man, and is generally discussed in close connection with malicious mischief.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been thought that the burning was not malicious where a prisoner set fire to his prison, not from a desire to consume the building, but solely to effect his escape.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"But it seems to be the better opinion that this is arson, /1/ in which case an intentional burning is malicious within the meaning of the rule.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we remember that arson was the subject of one of the old appeals which take us far back into the early law, /2/ we may readily understand that only intentional burnings were redressed in that way.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/3/ The appeal of arson was brother to the appeal de pace et plagis.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As the latter was founded on a warlike assault, the former supposed a house-firing for robbery or revenge, /4/ such as that by which Njal perished in the Icelandic Saga.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But this crime seems to have had the same history as others.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As soon as intent is admitted to be sufficient, the law is on the high-road to an external standard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A man who intentionally sets fire to his own house, which is so near to other houses that the fire will manifestly endanger them, is guilty of arson if one of the other houses is burned in consequence.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/5/ In this case, an act which would not [65] have been arson, taking only its immediate consequences into account, becomes arson by reason of more remote consequences which were manifestly likely to follow, whether they were actually intended or not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If that may be the effect of setting fire to things which a man has a right to burn, so far as they alone are concerned, why, on principle, should it not be the effect of any other act which is equally likely under the surrounding circumstances to cause the same harm.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Cases may easily be imagined where firing a gun, or making a chemical mixture, or piling up oiled rags, or twenty other things, might be manifestly dangerous in the highest degree and actually lead to a conflagration.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If, in such cases, the crime is held to have been committed, an external standard is reached, and the analysis which has been made of murder applies here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is another class of cases in which intent plays an important part, for quite different reasons from those which have been offered to account for the law of malicious mischief.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The most obvious examples of this class are criminal attempts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Attempt and intent, of course, are two distinct things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Intent to commit a crime is not itself criminal.,1,0,0,0,0,0
There is no law against a man's intending to commit a murder the day after tomorrow.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The law only deals with conduct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
An attempt is an overt act.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It differs from the attempted crime in this, that the act has failed to bring about the result which would have given it the character of the principal crime.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If an attempt to murder results in death within a year and a day, it is murder.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If an attempt to steal results in carrying off the owner's goods, it is larceny.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If an act is done of which the natural and probable [66] effect under the circumstances is the accomplishment of a substantive crime, the criminal law, while it may properly enough moderate the severity of punishment if the act has not that effect in the particular case, can hardly abstain altogether from punishing it, on any theory.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It has been argued that an actual intent is all that can give the act a criminal character in such instances.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ But if the views which I have advanced as to murder and manslaughter are sound, the same principles ought logically to determine the criminality of acts in general.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Acts should be judged by their tendency under the known circumstances, not by the actual intent which accompanies them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be true that in the region of attempts, as elsewhere, the law began with cases of actual intent, as those cases are the most obvious ones.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it cannot stop with them, unless it attaches more importance to the etymological meaning of the word attempt than to the general principles of punishment.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Accordingly there is at least color of authority for the proposition that an act is punishable as an attempt, if, supposing it to have produced its natural and probable effect, it would have amounted to a substantive crime.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ But such acts are not the only punishable attempts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is another class in which actual intent is clearly necessary, and the existence of this class as well as the name (attempt) no doubt tends to affect the whole doctrine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Some acts may be attempts or misdemeanors which [67] could not have effected the crime unless followed by other acts on the part of the wrong-doer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, lighting a match with intent to set fire to a haystack has been held to amount to a criminal attempt to burn it, although the defendant blew out the match on seeing that he was watched.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"/1/ So the purchase of dies for making counterfeit coin is a misdemeanor, although of course the coin would not be counterfeited unless the dies were used.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ In such cases the law goes on a new principle, different from that governing most substantive crimes.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The reason for punishing any act must generally be to prevent some harm which is foreseen as likely to follow that act under the circumstances in which it is done.,1,0,0,0,0,0
In most substantive crimes the ground on which that likelihood stands is the common working of natural causes as shown by experience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when an act is punished the natural effect of which is not harmful under the circumstances, that ground alone will not suffice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The probability does not exist unless there are grounds for expecting that the act done will be followed by other acts in connection with which its effect will be harmful, although not so otherwise.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But as in fact no such acts have followed, it cannot, in general, be assumed, from the mere doing of what has been done, that they would have followed if the actor had not been interrupted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They would not have followed it unless the actor had chosen, and the only way generally available to show that he would have chosen to do them is by showing that he intended to do them when he did what he did.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The accompanying intent in that case renders the otherwise [68] innocent act harmful, because it raises a probability that it will be followed by such other acts and events as will all together result in harm.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The importance of the intent is not to show that the act was wicked, but to show that it was likely to be followed by hurtful consequences.",1,0,0,0,0,0

There is one doubtful point which should not be passed over.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been thought that to shoot at a block of wood thinking it to be a man is not an attempt to murder, /1/ and that to put a hand into an empty pocket, intending to pick it, is not an attempt to commit larceny, although on the latter question there is a difference of opinion.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ The reason given is, that an act which could not have effected the crime if the actor had been allowed to follow it up to all results to which in the nature of things it could have led, cannot be an attempt to commit that crime when interrupted.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"At some point or other, of course, the law must adopt this conclusion, unless it goes on the theory of retribution for guilt, and not of prevention of harm.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But even to prevent harm effectually it will not do to be too exact.,1,0,0,0,0,0
I do not suppose that firing a pistol at a man with intent to kill him is any the less an attempt to murder because the bullet misses its aim.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"There remain to be considered certain substantive crimes, which differ in very important ways from murder and the like, and for the explanation of which the foregoing analysis of intent in criminal attempts and analogous misdemeanors will be found of service.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The type of these is larceny.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Under this name acts are punished which of themselves would not be sufficient to accomplish the evil which the law seeks to prevent, and which are treated as equally criminal, whether the evil has been accomplished or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0

In larceny the consequences immediately flowing from the act are generally exhausted with little or no harm to the owner.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Goods are removed from his possession by [71] trespass, and that is all, when the crime is complete.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But they must be permanently kept from him before the harm is done which the law seeks to prevent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A momentary loss of possession is not what has been guarded against with such severe penalties.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What the law means to prevent is the loss of it wholly and forever, as is shown by the fact that it is not larceny to take for a temporary use without intending to deprive the owner of his property.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If then the law punishes the mere act of taking, it punishes an act which will not of itself produce the evil effect sought to be prevented, and punishes it before that effect has in any way come to pass.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The reason is plain enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The law cannot wait until the property has been used up or destroyed in other hands than the owner's, or until the owner has died, in order to make sure that the harm which it seeks to prevent has been done.",1,0,0,0,0,0
And for the same reason it cannot confine itself to acts likely to do that harm.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"According to Mr Bishop, larceny is the taking and removing, by trespass, of personal property which the trespasser knows to belong either generally or specially to another, with the intent to deprive such owner of his ownership therein; and perhaps it should be added, for the sake of some advantage to the trespasser, a proposition on which the decisions are not harmonious.",1,0,0,0,0,0

That can hardly be.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The true answer is, that the intent is an index to the external event which probably would have happened, and that, if the law is to punish at all, it must, in this case, go on probabilities, not on accomplished facts.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"If theft can rightly be considered in this way, intent must play the same part as in other attempts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
An act which does not fully accomplish the prohibited result may be made wrongful by evidence that but for some interference it would have been followed by other acts co-ordinated with it to produce that result.,1,0,0,0,0,0
This can only be shown by showing intent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In theft the intent to deprive the owner of his property establishes that the thief would have retained, or would not have taken steps to restore, the stolen goods.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nor would it matter that the thief afterwards changed his mind and returned the goods.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"From the point of view of attempt, the crime was already complete when the property was carried off.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Suppose, for instance, that by one and the same motion a man seizes and backs another's horse over a precipice.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The whole evil which the law seeks to prevent is the natural and manifestly [73] certain consequence of the act under the known circumstances.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In such a case, if the law of larceny is consistent with the theories here maintained, the act should be passed upon according to its tendency, and the actual intent of the wrong-doer not in any way considered.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"In such cases the owner is deprived of his property by the thief's keeping it, not by its destruction, and the permanence of his loss can only be judged of beforehand by the intent to keep.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The intent is therefore always necessary, and it is naturally stated in the form of a self-regarding intent.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It was an advance on the old precedents when it was decided that the intent to deprive the owner of his property was sufficient.,0,0,0,0,0,0
As late as 1815 the English judges stood only six to five in favor of the proposition [74] that it was larceny to take a horse intending to kill it for no other purpose than to destroy evidence against a friend.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Even that case, however, did not do away with the universality of intent as a test, for the destruction followed the taking, and it is an ancient rule that the criminality of the act must be determined by the state of things at the time of the taking, and not afterwards.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether the law of larceny would follow what seems to be the general principle of criminal law, or would be held back by tradition, could only be decided by a case like that supposed above, where the same act accomplishes both taking and destruction.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"/1/ It is believed that enough has now been said to explain the general theory of criminal liability, as it stands at common law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The result may be summed up as follows.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All acts are indifferent per se.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In the characteristic type of substantive crime acts are rendered criminal because they are done finder circumstances in which they will probably cause some harm which the law seeks to prevent.,1,0,0,0,0,0
The test of criminality in such cases is the degree of danger shown by experience to attend that act under those circumstances.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"In such cases the mens rea, or actual wickedness of the party, is wholly unnecessary, and all reference to the state of his consciousness is misleading if it means anything more than that the circumstances in connection with which the tendency of his act is judged are the circumstances known to him.",1,1,0,1,1,0
Even the requirement of knowledge is subject to certain limitations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A man must find out at his peril things which a reasonable and prudent man would have inferred from the things actually known.,1,1,1,1,0,0
"In some cases, especially of statutory crimes, he must go even further, and, when he knows certain facts, must find out at his peril whether the other facts are present which would make the act criminal.",1,1,0,1,1,0
A man who abducts a girl from her parents in England must find out at his peril whether she is under sixteen.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"[76] In some cases it may be that the consequence of the act, under the circumstances, must be actually foreseen, if it is a consequence which a prudent man would not have foreseen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The reference to the prudent man, as a standard, is the only form in which blameworthiness as such is an element of crime, and what would be blameworthy in such a man is an element;--first, as a survival of true moral standards; second, because to punish what would not be blameworthy in an average member of the community would be to enforce a standard which was indefensible theoretically, and which practically was too high for that community.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In some cases, actual malice or intent, in the common meaning of those words, is an element in crime.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it will be found that, when it is so, it is because the act when done maliciously is followed by harm which would not have followed the act alone, or because the intent raises a strong probability that an act, innocent in itself, will be followed by other acts or events in connection with which it will accomplish the result sought to be prevented by the law.",1,0,0,0,0,0

-- TORTS.--TRESPASS AND NEGLIGENCE.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The object of the next two Lectures is to discover whether there is any common ground at the bottom of all liability in tort, and if so, what that ground is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Supposing the attempt to succeed, it will reveal the general principle of civil liability at common law.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The liabilities incurred by way of contract are more or less expressly fixed by the agreement of the parties concerned, but those arising from a tort are independent of any previous consent of the wrong-doer to bear the loss occasioned by his act.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"If A fails to pay a certain sum on a certain day, or to deliver a lecture on a certain night, after having made a binding promise to do so, the damages which he has to pay are recovered in accordance with his consent that some or all of the harms which may be caused by his failure shall fall upon him.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"But when A assaults or slanders his neighbor, or converts his neighbor's property, he does a harm which he has never consented to bear, and if the law makes him pay for it, the reason for doing so must be found in some general view of the conduct which every one may fairly expect and demand from every other, whether that other has agreed to it or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Such a general view is very hard to find.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The law did not begin with a theory.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It has never worked one out.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The tendency, which is our main concern, is a matter of fact to be gathered from the cases.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Ignorance is the best of law reformers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"People are glad to discuss a question on general principles, when they have forgotten the special knowledge necessary for technical reasoning.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But the present willingness to generalize is founded on more than merely negative grounds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The philosophical habit of the day, the frequency of legislation, and the ease with which the law may be changed to meet the opinions and wishes of the public, all make it natural and unavoidable that judges as well as others should openly discuss the legislative principles upon which their decisions must always rest in the end, and should base their judgments upon broad considerations of policy to which the traditions of the bench would hardly have tolerated a reference fifty years ago.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"[79] The business of the law of torts is to fix the dividing lines between those cases in which a man is liable for harm which he has done, and those in which he is not.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"But it cannot enable him to predict with certainty whether a given act under given circumstances will make him liable, because an act will rarely have that effect unless followed by damage, and for the most part, if not always, the consequences of an act are not known, but only guessed at as more or less probable.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"All the rules that the law can lay down beforehand are rules for determining the conduct which will be followed by liability if it is followed by harm--that is, the conduct which a man pursues at his peril.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"The only guide for the future to be drawn from a decision against a defendant in an action of tort is that similar acts, under circumstances which cannot be distinguished except by the result from those of the defendant, are done at the peril of the actor; that if he escapes liability, it is simply because by good fortune no harm comes of his conduct in the particular event.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If, therefore, there is any common ground for all liability in tort, we shall best find it by eliminating the event as it actually turns out, and by considering only the principles on which the peril of his conduct is thrown upon the actor.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"We are to ask what are the elements, on the defendant's side, which must all be present before liability is possible, and the presence of which will commonly make him liable if damage follows.",1,1,1,1,1,1
The law of torts abounds in moral phraseology.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has much to say of wrongs, of malice, fraud, intent, and negligence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hence it may naturally be supposed that the risk of a man's conduct is thrown upon him as the result of some moral short-coming.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"But while this notion has been [80] entertained, the extreme opposite will be found to have been a far more popular opinion;--I mean the notion that a man is answerable for all the consequences of his acts, or, in other words, that he acts at his peril always, and wholly irrespective of the state of his consciousness upon the matter.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"To test the former opinion it would be natural to take up successively the several words, such as negligence and intent, which in the language of morals designate various well-understood states of mind, and to show their significance in the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To test the latter, it would perhaps be more convenient to consider it under the head of the several forms of action.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"So many of our authorities are decisions under one or another of these forms, that it will not be safe to neglect them, at least in the first instance; and a compromise between the two modes of approaching the subject may be reached by beginning with the action of trespass and the notion of negligence together, leaving wrongs which are defined as intentional for the next Lecture.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Trespass lies for unintentional, as well as for intended wrongs.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Any wrongful and direct application of force is redressed by that action.,1,0,0,0,0,0
It therefore affords a fair field for a discussion of the general principles of liability for unintentional wrongs at common law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
For it can hardly be supposed that a man's responsibility for the consequences of his acts varies as the remedy happens to fall on one side or the other of the penumbra which separates trespass from the action on the case.,1,1,1,1,1,1
And the greater part of the law of torts will be found under one or the other of those two heads.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It might be hastily assumed that the action on the case [81] is founded on the defendant's negligence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if that be so, the same doctrine must prevail in trespass.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It might be assumed that trespass is founded on the defendant's having caused damage by his act, without regard to negligence.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"But if that be true, the law must apply the same criterion to other wrongs differing from trespass only in some technical point; as, for instance, that the property damaged was in the defendant's possession.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Neither of the above assumptions, however, can be hastily permitted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It might very well be argued that the action on the case adopts the severe rule just suggested for trespass, except when the action is founded on a contract.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Negligence, it might be said, had nothing to do with the common-law liability for a nuisance, and it might be added that, where negligence was a ground of liability, a special duty had to be founded in the defendant's super se assumpsit, or public calling.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ On the other hand, we shall see what can be said for the proposition, that even in trespass there must at least be negligence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But whichever argument prevails for the one form of action must prevail for the other.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The discussion may therefore be shortened on its technical side, by confining it to trespass so far as may be practicable without excluding light to be got from other parts of the law.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As has just been hinted, there are two theories of the common-law liability for unintentional harm.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Both of them seem to receive the implied assent of popular textbooks, and neither of them is wanting in plausibility and the semblance of authority.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The first is that of Austin, which is essentially the theory of a criminalist.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"According to him, the characteristic [82] feature of law, properly so called, is a sanction or detriment threatened and imposed by the sovereign for disobedience to the sovereign's commands.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As the greater part of the law only makes a man civilly answerable for breaking it, Austin is compelled to regard the liability to an action as a sanction, or, in other words, as a penalty for disobedience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It follows from this, according to the prevailing views of penal law, that such liability ought only to be based upon personal fault; and Austin accepts that conclusion, with its corollaries, one of which is that negligence means a state of the party's mind.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"According to this view, broadly stated, under the common law a man acts at his peril.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"It may be held as a sort of set-off, that he is never liable for omissions except in consequence of some duty voluntarily undertaken.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the whole and sufficient ground for such liabilities as he does incur outside the last class is supposed to be that he has voluntarily acted, and that damage has ensued.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"If the act was voluntary, it is totally immaterial that the detriment which followed from it was neither intended nor due to the negligence of the actor.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In order to do justice to this way of looking at the subject, we must remember that the abolition of the common-law forms of pleading has not changed the rules of substantive law.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Now suppose that, instead of a dealing with the plaintiff's property, the case is that force has proceeded directly from the defendant's body to the plaintiff's body, it is urged that, as the law cannot be less careful of the persons than of the property of its subjects, the only defences possible are similar to those which would have been open to an alleged trespass on land.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"You may show that there was no trespass by showing that the defendant did no act; as where he was thrown from his horse upon the plaintiff, or where a third person took his hand and struck the plaintiff with it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In such cases the defendant's body is file passive instrument of an external force, and the bodily motion relied on by the plaintiff is not his act at all.",1,1,1,1,1,1
So you may show a justification or excuse in the conduct of the plaintiff himself.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"But if no such excuse is shown, and the defendant has voluntarily acted, he must answer [84] for the consequences, however little intended and however unforeseen.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"If, for instance, being assaulted by a third person, the defendant lifted his stick and accidentally hit the plaintiff, who was standing behind him, according to this view he is liable, irrespective of any negligence toward the party injured.",1,1,1,1,1,1

"If one is cutting trees, and the boughs fall on a man and wound him, in this case he shall have an action of trespass, &c., and also, sir, if one is shooting at butts, and his bow shakes in his hands, and kills a man, ipso invito, it is no felony, as has been said, [86] &c.; but if he wounds one by shooting, he shall have a good action of trespass against him, and yet the shooting was lawful, &c., and the wrong which the other receives was against his will, &c.; and so here, &c.

And so if one assaults me and I cannot escape, and I in self-defence lift my stick to strike him, and in lifting it hit a man who is behind me, in this case he shall have an action against me, yet my raising my stick was lawful in self-defence, and I hit him, me invito, &c.; and so here, &C.

Choke, C. J. to the same intent, for when the principal thing was not lawful, that which depends upon it was not lawful; for when he cut the thorns and they fell on my land, [87] this falling was not lawful, and therefore his coming to take them out was not lawful.",1,0,0,0,0,0

I will begin with the latter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The same reasoning which would make a man answerable in trespass for all damage to another by force directly resulting from his own act, irrespective of negligence or intent, would make him answerable in case for the like damage similarly resulting from the act of his servant, in the course of the latter's employment.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The discussions of the company's negligence in many railway cases would therefore be wholly out of place, for although, to be sure, there is a contract which would make the company liable for negligence, that contract cannot be taken to diminish any liability which would otherwise exist for a trespass on the part of its employees.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"The distinction between a direct application of force, and causing damage indirectly, or as a more remote consequence of one's act, although it may determine whether the form of action should be trespass or case, does not touch the theory of responsibility, if that theory be that a man acts at his peril.",1,1,1,1,0,0

"Hard spurring is just so much more likely to lead to harm than merely riding a horse in the street, that the court thought that the defendant would be bound to look out for the consequences of the one, while it would not hold him liable for those resulting merely from the other; [94] because the possibility of being run away with when riding quietly, though familiar, is comparatively slight.",1,1,1,1,1,1

"Were this not so, the almost universal acceptance of the first proposition in this Lecture, that the general foundation of liability for unintentional wrongs is conduct different from that of a prudent man under the circumstances, would leave all our rights and duties throughout a great part of the law to the necessarily more or less accidental feelings of a jury.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"In the discussion of unintentional wrongs, the greatest difficulty to be overcome was found to be the doctrine that a man acts always at his peril.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"In what follows, on the other hand, the difficulty will be to prove that actual wickedness of the kind described by the several words just mentioned is not an element in the civil wrongs to which those words are applied.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been shown, in dealing with the criminal law, that, when we call an act malicious in common speech, we mean that harm to another person was intended to come of it, and that such harm was desired for its own sake as an end in itself.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For the purposes of the criminal law, however, intent alone was found to be important, and to have the same consequences as intent with malevolence superadded.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Pursuing the analysis, intent was found to be made up of foresight of the harm as a consequence, coupled with a desire to bring it about, the latter being conceived as the motive for the act in question.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Of these, again, foresight only seemed material.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As a last step, foresight was reduced to its lowest term, and it was concluded that, subject to exceptions which were explained, the general basis of criminal liability was knowledge, at the time of action, [131] of facts from which common experience showed that certain harmful results were likely to follow.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It remains to be seen whether a similar reduction is possible on the civil side of the law, and whether thus fraudulent, malicious, intentional, and negligent wrongs can be brought into a philosophically continuous series.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A word of preliminary explanation will be useful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been shown in the Lecture just referred to that an act, although always importing intent, is per se indifferent to the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a willed, and therefore an intended coordination of muscular contractions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But the intent necessarily imported by the act ends there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And all muscular motions or co-ordinations of them are harmless apart from concomitant circumstances, the presence of which is not necessarily implied by the act itself.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To strike out with the fist is the same act, whether done in a desert or in a crowd.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The same considerations which have been urged to show that an act alone, by itself, does not and ought not to impose either civil or criminal liability, apply, at least frequently, to a series of acts, or to conduct, although the series shows a further co-ordination and a further intent.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, it is the same series of acts to utter a sentence falsely stating that a certain barrel contains No.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"1 Mackerel, whether the sentence is uttered in the secrecy of the closet, or to another man in the course of a bargain.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is, to be sure, in either case, the further intent, beyond the co-ordination of muscles for a single sound, to allege that a certain barrel has certain contents,--an intent necessarily shown by the ordering of the words.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But both the series of acts and the intent are per se indifferent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They are innocent when spoken in solitude, and [132] are only a ground of liability when certain concomitant circumstances are shown.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The intent which is meant when spoken of as an element of legal liability is an intent directed toward the harm complained of, or at least toward harm.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is not necessary in every case to carry the analysis back to the simple muscular contractions out of which a course of conduct is made up.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the same principle that requires something more than an act followed by damage to make a man liable, we constantly find ourselves at liberty to assume a co-ordinated series of acts as a proximately simple element, per se indifferent, in considering what further circumstances or facts must be present before the conduct in question is at the actor's peril.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It will save confusion and the need of repetition if this is borne in mind in the following discussion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The chief forms of liability in which fraud, malice, and intent are said to be necessary elements, are deceit, slander and libel, malicious prosecution, and conspiracy, to which, perhaps, may be added trover.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Deceit is a notion drawn from the moral world, and in its popular sense distinctly imports wickedness.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The doctrine of the common law with regard to it is generally stated in terms which are only consistent with actual guilt, and all actual guilty intent.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is said that a man is liable to an action for deceit if he makes a false representation to another, knowing it to be false, but intending that the other should believe and act upon it, if the person addressed believes it, and is thereby persuaded to act to his own harm.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is no doubt the typical case, and it is a case of intentional moral wrong.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, what is the party's conduct here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It consists in uttering certain words, [133] so ordered that the utterance of them imports a knowledge of the meaning which they would convey if heard.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But that conduct with only that knowledge is neither moral nor immoral.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Go one step further, and add the knowledge of another's presence within hearing, still the act has no determinate character.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The elements which make it immoral are the knowledge that the statement is false, and the intent that it shall be acted on.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The principal question then is, whether this intent can be reduced to the same terms as it has been in other cases.",1,0,0,0,0,0
There is no difficulty in the answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is perfectly clear that the intent that a false representation should be acted on would be conclusively established by proof that the defendant knew that the other party intended to act upon it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the defendant foresaw the consequence of his acts, he is chargeable, whether his motive was a desire to induce the other party to act, or simply an unwillingness for private reasons to state the truth.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"If the defendant knew a present fact (the other party's intent), which, according to common experience, made it likely that his act would have the harmful consequence, he is chargeable, whether he in fact foresaw the consequence or not.",1,1,1,1,1,1
In this matter the general conclusion follows from a single instance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For the moment it is admitted that in one case knowledge of a present fact, such as the other party's intent to act on the false statement, dispenses with proof of an intent to induce him to act upon it, it is admitted that the lesser element is all that is necessary in the larger compound.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For intent embraces knowledge sufficing for foresight, as has been shown.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence, when you prove intent you prove knowledge, and intent may often [134] be the easier to prove of the two.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But when you prove knowledge you do not prove intent.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be said, however, that intent is implied or presumed in such a case as has been supposed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But this is only helping out a false theory by a fiction.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is very much like saying that a consideration is presumed for an instrument under seal; which is merely a way of reconciling the formal theory that all contracts must have a consideration with the manifest fact that sealed instruments do not require one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Whenever it is said that a certain thing is essential to liability, but that it is conclusively presumed from something else, there is always ground for suspicion that the essential clement is to be found in that something else, and not in what is said to be presumed from it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"With regard to the intent necessary to deceit, we need not stop with the single instance which has been given.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The law goes no farther than to require proof either of the intent, or that the other party was justified in inferring such intention.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So that the whole meaning of the requirement is, that the natural and manifest tendency of the representation, under the known circumstances, must have been to induce the opinion that it was made with a view to action, and so to induce action on the faith of it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The standard of what is called intent is thus really an external standard of conduct under the known circumstances, and the analysis of the criminal law holds good here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Nor is this all.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The law pursuing its course of specification, as explained in the last Lecture, decides what is the tendency of representations in certain cases,--as, for instance, that a horse is sound at the time of making a [135] sale; or, in general, of any statement of fact which it is known the other party intends to rely on.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Beyond these scientific rules lies the vague realm of the jury.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The other moral element in deceit is knowledge that the statement was false.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With this I am not strictly concerned, because all that is necessary is accomplished when the elements of risk are reduced to action and knowledge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it will aid in the general object of showing that the tendency of the law everywhere is to transcend moral and reach external standards, if this knowledge of falsehood can be transmuted into a formula not necessarily importing guilt, although, of course, generally accompanied by it in fact.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The moment we look critically at it, we find the moral side shade away.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The question is, what known circumstances are enough throw the risk of a statement upon him who makes it, if it induces another man to act, and it turns out untrue.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Now, it is evident that a man may take the risk of his statement by express agreement, or by an implied one which the law reads into his bargain.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"He may in legal language warrant the truth of it, and if it is not true, the law treats it as a fraud, just as much when he makes it fully believing it, as when he knows that it is untrue, and means to deceive.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"If, in selling a horse, the seller warranted him to be only five years old, and in fact he was thirteen, the seller could be sued for a deceit at common law, although he thought the horse was only five.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ The common-law liability for the truth of statements is, therefore, more extensive than the sphere of actual moral fraud.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, again, it is enough in general if a representation [136] is made recklessly, without knowing whether it is true or false.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Now what does recklessly mean.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It does not mean actual personal indifference to the truth of the statement.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It means only that the data for the statement were so far insufficient that a prudent man could not have made it without leading to the inference that he was indifferent.,1,1,1,1,0,0
"That is to say, repeating an analysis which has been gone through with before, it means that the law, applying a general objective standard, determines that, if a man makes his statement on those data, he is liable, whatever was the state of his mind, and although he individually may have been perfectly free from wickedness in making it.",1,1,1,1,0,0
Hence similar reasoning to that which has been applied already to intent may be applied to knowledge of falsity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Actual knowledge may often be easier to prove than that the evidence was insufficient to warrant the statement, and when proved it contains the lesser element.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But as soon as the lesser element is shown to be enough, it is shown that the law is ready to apply an external or objective standard here also.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Courts of equity have laid down the doctrine in terms which are so wholly irrespective of the actual moral condition of the defendant as to go to an opposite extreme.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is said that when a representation in a matter of business is made by one man to another calculated to induce him to adapt his conduct to it, it is perfectly immaterial whether the representation is made knowing it to be untrue, or whether it is made believing it to be true, if, in fact, it was untrue.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Perhaps the actual decisions could be reconciled on a [137] narrower principle, but the rule just stated goes the length of saying that in business matters a man makes every statement (of a kind likely to be acted on) at his peril.",1,1,1,1,0,0
This seems hardly justifiable in policy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The moral starting point of liability in general should never be forgotten, and the law cannot without disregarding it hold a man answerable for statements based on facts which would have convinced a wise and prudent man of their truth.",1,0,0,0,0,0

It does not hold that a man always speaks at his peril.,1,1,1,1,1,1

"As in other cases, it is gradually accumulating precedents which decide that certain statements under certain circumstances are at the peril of the party who makes them.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The elements of deceit which throw the risk of his conduct upon a party are these.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, making a statement of facts purporting to be serious.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Second, the known presence of another within hearing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Third, known facts sufficient to warrant the expectation or suggest the probability that the other party will act on the statement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"(What facts are sufficient has been specifically determined by the courts in some instances; in others, no doubt, the question would go to the jury on the principles heretofore explained.)",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Fourth, the [138] falsehood of the statement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This must be known, or else the known evidence concerning the matter of the statement must be such as would not warrant belief according to the ordinary course of human experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
(On this point also the court may be found to lay down specific rules in some cases.,0,0,0,0,0,0
/1/) I next take up the law of slander.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has often been said that malice is one of the elements of liability, and the doctrine is commonly stated in this way: that malice must exist, but that it is presumed by law from the mere speaking of the words; that again you may rebut this presumption of malice by showing that the words were spoken under circumstances which made the communication privileged,--as, for instance, by a lawyer in the necessary course of his argument, or by a person answering in good faith to inquiries as to the character of a former servant,-- and then, it is said, the plaintiff may meet this defence in some cases by showing that the words were spoken with actual malice.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"All this sounds as if at least actual intent to cause the damage complained of, if not malevolence, were at the bottom of this class of wrongs.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Yet it is not so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For although the use of the phrase malice points as usual to an original moral standard, the rule that it is presumed upon proof of speaking certain words is equivalent to saying that the overt conduct of speaking those words may be actionable whether the consequence of damage to the plaintiff was intended or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And this fails in with the general theory, because the manifest tendency of slanderous words is to harm the person of whom they are spoken.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, the real substance of the defence is not that the damage [139] was not intended,--that would be no defence at all; but that, whether it was intended or not,--that is, even if the defendant foresaw it and foresaw it with pleasure,--the manifest facts and circumstances under which he said it were such that the law considered the damage to the plaintiff of less importance than the benefit of free speaking.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"It is more difficult to apply the same analysis to the last stage of the process, but perhaps it is not impossible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is said that the plaintiff may meet a case of privilege thus made out on the part of the defendant, by proving actual malice, that is, actual intent to cause the damage complained of.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But how is this actual malice made out?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is by showing that the defendant knew the statement which he made was false, or that his untrue statements were grossly in excess of what the occasion required.",1,1,1,1,1,1
Now is it not very evident that the law is looking to a wholly different matter from the defendant's intent?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The fact that the defendant foresaw and foresaw with pleasure the damage to the plaintiff, is of no more importance in this case than it would be where the communication was privileged.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The question again is wholly a question of knowledge, or other external standard.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And what makes even knowledge important?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is that the reason for which a man is allowed in the other instances to make false charges against his neighbors is wanting.,1,1,1,1,0,0
"It is for the public interest that people should be free to give the best information they can under certain circumstances without fear, but there is no public benefit in having lies told at any time; and when a charge is known to be false, or is in excess of what is required by the occasion, it is not necessary to make that charge in order to speak freely, and [140] therefore it falls under the ordinary rule, that certain charges are made at the party's peril in case they turn out to be false, whether evil consequences were intended or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The defendant is liable, not because his intent was evil, but because he made false charges without excuse.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"It will be seen that the peril of conduct here begins farther back than with deceit, as the tendency of slander is more universally harmful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There must be some concomitant circumstances.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There must at least be a human being in existence whom the statement designates.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There must be another human being within hearing who understands the statement, and the statement must be false.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is arguable that the latter of these facts need not be known, as certainly the falsity of the charge need not be, and that a man must take the risk of even an idle statement being heard, unless he made it under known circumstances of privilege.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"It would be no great curtailment of freedom to deny a man immunity in attaching a charge of crime to the name of his neighbor, even when he supposes himself alone.",1,1,0,1,1,0
But it does not seem clear that the law would go quite so far as that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The next form of liability is comparatively insignificant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I mean the action for malicious prosecution.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A man may recover damages against another for maliciously and without probable cause instituting a criminal, or, in some cases, a civil prosecution against him upon a false charge.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"The want of probable cause refers, of course, only to the state of the defendant's knowledge, not to his intent.",1,1,1,1,1,1
It means the absence of probable cause in the facts known to the defendant when he instituted the suit.,1,1,1,1,1,1
But the standard applied to the defendant's consciousness is external to it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The question is not whether he thought the [141] facts to constitute probable cause, but whether the court thinks they did.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Then as to malice.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The conduct of the defendant consists in instituting proceedings on a charge which is in fact false, and which has not prevailed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is the root of the whole matter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the charge was true, or if the plaintiff has been convicted, even though he may be able now to prove that he was wrongly convicted, the defendant is safe, however great his malice, and however little ground he had for his charge.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Suppose, however, that the charge is false, and does not prevail.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It may readily be admitted that malice did originally mean a malevolent motive, an actual intent to harm the plaintiff by making a false charge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The legal remedy here, again, started from the moral basis, the occasion for it, no doubt, being similar to that which gave rise to the old law of conspiracy, that a man's enemies would sometimes seek his destruction by setting the criminal law in motion against him.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"As it was punishable to combine for such a purpose, it was concluded, with some hesitation, that, when a single individual wickedly attempted the same thing, he should be liable on similar grounds.",1,1,1,1,1,1
/1/ I must fully admit that there is weighty authority to the effect that malice in its ordinary sense is to this day a distinct fact to be proved and to be found by the jury.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But this view cannot be accepted without hesitation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is admitted that, on the one side, the existence of probable cause, believed in, is a justification notwithstanding malice; /2/ that, on the other, it is not enough to show [142] that the case appeared sufficient to this particular party, but it must be sufficient to induce a sober, sensible and discreet person to act upon it, or it must fail as a justification for the proceeding upon general grounds.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ On the one side, malice alone will not make a man liable for instituting a groundless prosecution; on the other, his justification will depend, not on his opinion of the facts, but on that of the court.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"When his actual moral condition is disregarded to this extent, it is a little hard to believe that the existence of an improper motive should be material.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yet that is what malice must mean in this case, if it means anything.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ For the evil effects of a successful indictment are of course intended by one who procures all other to be indicted.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I cannot but think that a jury would be told that knowledge or belief that the charge was false at the time of making it was conclusive evidence of malice.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"And if so, on grounds which need not be repeated, malice is not the important thing, but the facts known to the defendant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nevertheless, as it is obviously treading on delicate ground to make it actionable to set the regular processes of the law in motion, it is, of course, entirely possible to say that the action shall be limited to those cases where the charge was preferred from improper motives, at least if the defendant thought that there was probable cause.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Such a limitation would stand almost alone in the law of civil liability.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the nature of the wrong is peculiar, and, moreover, it is quite consistent with the theory of liability here advanced that it should be confined in any given instance to actual wrong-doing in a moral sense.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The only other cause of action in which the moral condition [143] of the defendant's consciousness might seem to be important is conspiracy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The old action going by that name was much like malicious prosecution, and no doubt was originally confined to cases where several persons had conspired to indict another from malevolent motives.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But in the modern action on the case, where conspiracy is charged, the allegation as a rule only means that two or more persons were so far co-operating in their acts that the act of any one was the act of all.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Generally speaking, the liability depends not on the co-operation or conspiring, but on the character of the acts done, supposing them all to be done by one man, or irrespective of the question whether they were done by one or several.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"There may be cases, to be sure, in which the result could not be accomplished, or the offence could not ordinarily be proved, without a combination of several; as, for instance, the removal of a teacher by a school board.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The conspiracy would not affect the case except in a practical way, but the question would be raised whether, notwithstanding the right of the board to remove, proof that they were actuated by malevolence would not make a removal actionable.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Policy, it might be said, forbids going behind their judgment, but actual evil motives coupled with the absence of grounds withdraw this protection, because policy, although it does not require them to take the risk of being right, does require that they should judge honestly on the merits.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Other isolated instances like the last might, perhaps, be found in different parts of the law, in which actual malevolence would affect a man's liability for his conduct.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Again, in trover for the conversion of another's chattel, where the dominion exercised over it was of a slight and ambiguous [144] nature, it has been said that the taking must be with the intent of exercising an ownership over the chattel inconsistent with the real owner's right of possession.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ But this seems to be no more than a faint shadow of the doctrine explained with regard to larceny, and does not require any further or special discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Trover is commonly understood to go, like larceny, on the plaintiff's being deprived of his property, although in practice every possessor has the action, and, generally speaking, the shortest wrongful withholding of possession is a conversion.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Be the exceptions more or less numerous, the general purpose of the law of torts is to secure a man indemnity against certain forms of harm to person, reputation, or estate, at the hands of his neighbors, not because they are wrong, but because they are harms.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The true explanation of the reference of liability to a moral standard, in the sense which has been explained, is not that it is for the purpose of improving men's hearts, but that it is to give a man a fair chance to avoid doing the harm before he is held responsible for it.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"It is intended to reconcile the policy of letting accidents lie where they fall, and the reasonable freedom of others with the protection of the individual from injury.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But the law does not even seek to indemnify a man from all harms.,0,0,0,0,0,0
An unrestricted enjoyment of all his possibilities would interfere with other equally important enjoyments on the part of his neighbors.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"There are certain things which the law allows a man to do, notwithstanding the fact that he foresees that harm to another will follow from them.",1,1,1,1,0,0
He may charge a man with crime if the charge is true.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He may establish himself in business where he foresees that [145] of his competition will be to diminish the custom of another shopkeeper, perhaps to ruin him.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"He may a building which cuts another off from a beautiful prospect, or he may drain subterranean waters and thereby drain another's well; and many other cases might be put.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"As any of these things may be done with foresight of their evil consequences, it would seem that they might be done with intent, and even with malevolent intent, to produce them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The whole argument of this Lecture and the preceding tends to this conclusion.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the aim of liability is simply to prevent or indemnify from harm so far as is consistent with avoiding the extreme of making a man answer for accident, when the law permits the harm to be knowingly inflicted it would be a strong thing if the presence of malice made any difference in its decisions.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"That might happen, to be sure, without affecting the general views maintained here, but it is not to be expected, and the weight of authority is against it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As the law, on the one hand, allows certain harms to be inflicted irrespective of the moral condition of him who inflicts them, so, at the other extreme, it may on grounds of policy throw the absolute risk of certain transactions on the person engaging in them, irrespective of blameworthiness in any sense.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Instances of this sort have been mentioned in the last Lecture, /1/ and will be referred to again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Most liabilities in tort lie between these two extremes, and are founded on the infliction of harm which the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to avoid at the time of the acts or omissions which were its proximate cause.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Rut as fast as specific rules are worked out in place of the [146] vague reference to the conduct of the average man, they range themselves alongside of other specific rules based on public policy, and the grounds from which they spring cease to be manifest.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"So that, as will be seen directly, rules which seem to lie outside of culpability in any sense have sometimes been referred to remote fault, while others which started from the general notion of negligence may with equal ease be referred to some extrinsic ground of policy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Apart from the extremes just mentioned, it is now easy to see how the point at which a man's conduct begins to be at his own peril is generally fixed.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"When the principle is understood on which that point is determined by the law of torts, we possess a common ground of classification, and a key to the whole subject, so far as tradition has not swerved the law from a consistent theory.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been made pretty clear from what precedes, that I find that ground in knowledge of circumstances accompanying an act or conduct indifferent but for those circumstances.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is worth remarking, before that criterion is discussed, that a possible common ground is reached at the preceding step in the descent from malice through intent and foresight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Foresight is a possible common denominator of wrongs at the two extremes of malice and negligence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The purpose of the law is to prevent or secure a man indemnity from harm at the hands of his neighbors, so far as consistent with other considerations which have been mentioned, and excepting, of course, such harm as it permits to be intentionally inflicted.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"When a man foresees that harm will result from his conduct, the principle which exonerates him from accident no longer applies, and he is liable.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"But, as has been shown, he is bound to foresee [147] whatever a prudent and intelligent man would have foreseen, and therefore he is liable for conduct from which such a man would have foreseen that harm was liable to follow.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"Accordingly, it would be possible to state all cases of negligence in terms of imputed or presumed foresight.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would be possible even to press the presumption further, applying the very inaccurate maxim, that every man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his own acts; and this mode of expression will, in fact, be found to have been occasionally used, /1/ more especially in the criminal law, where the notion of intent has a stronger foothold.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"/2/ The latter fiction is more remote and less philosophical than the former; but, after all, both are equally fictions.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Negligence is not foresight, but precisely the want of it; and if foresight were presumed, the ground of the presumption, and therefore the essential element, would be the knowledge of facts which made foresight possible.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Taking knowledge, then, as the true starting-point, the next question is how to determine the circumstances necessary to be known in any given case in order to make a man liable for the consequences of his act.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"They must be such as would have led a prudent man to perceive danger, although not necessarily to foresee the specific harm.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But this is a vague test.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How is it decided what those circumstances are?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The answer must be, by experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there is one point which has been left ambiguous in the preceding Lecture and here, and which must be touched upon.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been assumed that conduct which [148] the man of ordinary intelligence would perceive to be dangerous under the circumstances, would be blameworthy if pursued by him.",1,1,1,1,1,1

"Suppose that, acting under the threats of twelve armed men, which put him in fear of his life, a man enters another's close and takes a horse.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"In such a case, he actually contemplates and chooses harm to another as the consequence of his act.",1,1,0,1,1,0
Yet the act is neither blameworthy nor punishable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it might be actionable, and Rolle, C. J. ruled that it was so in Gilbert v. Stone.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ If this be law, it goes the full length of deciding that it is enough if the defendant has had a chance to avoid inflicting the harm complained of.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And it may well be argued that, although he does wisely to ransom his life as he best may, there is no reason why he should be allowed to intentionally and permanently transfer his misfortunes to the shoulders of his neighbors.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"It cannot be inferred, from the mere circumstance that certain conduct is made actionable, that therefore the law regards it as wrong, or seeks to prevent it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Under our mill acts a man has to pay for flowing his neighbor's lands, in the same way that he has to pay in trover for converting his neighbor's goods.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Yet the law approves and encourages the flowing of lands for the erection of mills.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Moral predilections must not be allowed to influence our minds in settling legal distinctions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we accept the test of the liability alone, how do we distinguish between trover and the mill acts?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Or between conduct which is prohibited, and that which is merely taxed?",0,0,0,0,0,0
The only distinction which I can see is in the difference of the collateral consequences attached to the two classes of conduct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the one, the maxim in pari delicto potior est [149] conditio defendentis, and the invalidity of contracts contemplating it, show that the conduct is outside the protection of the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"/1/ This opinion is confirmed by the fact, that almost the only cases in which the distinction between prohibition and taxation comes up concern the application of these maxims.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if this be true, liability to an action does not necessarily import wrong-doing.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"But, aside from such exceptional cases as Gilbert v. Stone, the two tests agree, and the difference need not be considered in what follows.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"I therefore repeat, that experience is the test by which it is decided whether the degree of danger attending given conduct under certain known circumstances is sufficient to throw the risk upon the party pursuing it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, experience shows that a good many guns supposed to be unloaded go off and hurt people.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The ordinarily intelligent and prudent member of the community [150] would foresee the possibility of danger from pointing a gun which he had not inspected into a crowd, and pulling the trigger, although it was said to be unloaded.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"The co-ordinated acts necessary to point a gun and pull a trigger, and the intent and knowledge shown by the co-ordination of those acts, are all consistent with entire blamelessness.",1,0,0,0,0,0
They threaten harm to no one without further facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But the one additional circumstance of a man in the line and within range of the piece makes the conduct manifestly dangerous to any one who knows the fact.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is no longer any need to refer to the prudent man, or general experience.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"He who snaps a cap upon a gun pointed in the direction of another person, known by him to be present, is answerable for the consequences.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The question what a prudent man would do under given circumstances is then equivalent to the question what are the teachings of experience as to the dangerous character of this or that conduct under these or those circumstances; and as the teachings of experience are matters of fact, it is easy to see why the jury should be consulted with regard to them.",1,0,0,0,0,0

Their function is to suggest a rule of conduct.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sometimes courts are induced to lay down rules by facts of a more specific nature; as that the legislature passed a certain statute, and that the case at bar is within [151] the fair meaning of its words; or that the practice of a specially interested class, or of the public at large, has generated a rule of conduct outside the law which it is desirable that the courts should recognize and enforce.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"These are matters of fact, and have sometimes been pleaded as such.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as their only importance is, that, if believed, they will induce the judges to lay down a rule of conduct, or in other words a rule of law, suggested by them, their tendency in most instances is to disappear as fast as the rules suggested by them become settled.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ While the facts are uncertain, as they are still only motives for decision upon the law,--grounds for legislation, so to speak,--the judges may ascertain them in any way which satisfies their conscience.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"But many instances will be found the text-books which show that, when the facts are ascertained, they soon cease to be referred to, and give place to a rule of law.",1,0,0,0,0,0
[152] The same transition is noticeable with regard to the teachings of experience.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are many cases, no doubt, in which the court would lean for aid upon a jury; but there are also many in which the teaching has been formulated in specific rules.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These rules will be found to vary considerably with regard to the number of concomitant circumstances necessary to throw the peril of conduct otherwise indifferent on the actor.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The difficulty of distinguishing rules based on other grounds of policy from those which have been worked out in the field of negligence, will be particularly noticed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In all these cases it will be found that there has been a voluntary act on the part of the person to be charged.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The reason for this requirement was shown in the foregoing Lecture.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Unnecessary though it is for the defendant to have intended or foreseen the evil which he has caused, it is necessary that he should have chosen the conduct which led to it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But it has also been shown that a voluntary act is not enough, and that even a co-ordinated series of acts or conduct is often not enough by itself.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the co-ordination of a series of acts shows a further intent than is necessarily manifested by any single act, and sometimes proves with almost equal certainty the knowledge of one or more concomitant circumstances.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And there are cases where conduct with only the intent and knowledge thus necessarily implied is sufficient to throw the risk of it on the actor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, when a man does the series of acts called [153] walking, it is assumed for all purposes of responsibility that he knows the earth is under his feet.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The conduct per se is indifferent, to be sure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A man may go through the motions of walking without legal peril, if he chooses to practise on a private treadmill; but if he goes through the same motions on the surface of the earth, it cannot be doubted that he knows that the earth is there.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"With that knowledge, he acts at his peril in certain respects.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"If he crosses his neighbor's boundary, he is a trespasser.",1,1,0,1,1,0
The reasons for this strict rule have been partially discussed in the last Lecture.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Possibly there is more of history or of past or present notions of policy its explanation than is there suggested, and at any rate I do not care to justify the rule.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is intelligible.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A man who walks knows that he is moving over the surface of the earth, he knows that he is surrounded by private estates which he has no right to enter, and he knows that his motion, unless properly guided, will carry him into those estates.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"He is thus warned, and the burden of his conduct is thrown upon himself.",1,1,0,1,1,0
But the act of walking does not throw the peril of all possible consequences upon him.,1,1,1,1,1,1

But the interest attaching to the theory of possession does not stop with its practical importance in the body of English law.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The theory has fallen into the hands of the philosophers, and with them has become a corner-stone of more than one elaborate structure.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It will be a service to sound thinking to show that a far more civilized system than the Roman is framed upon a plan which is irreconcilable with the a priori doctrines of Kant and Hegel.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Those doctrines are worked out in careful correspondence with German views of Roman law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And most of the speculative jurists of Germany, from Savigny to Ihering, have been at once professors of Roman law, and profoundly influenced if not controlled by some form of Kantian or post-Kantian philosophy.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Thus everything has combined to give a special bent to German speculation, which deprives it of its claim to universal authority.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Why is possession protected by the law, when the possessor is not also an owner?",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is the general problem which has much exercised the German mind.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Kant, it is well known, was deeply influenced in his opinions upon ethics and law by the speculations of Rousseau.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Kant, Rousseau, and the Massachusetts Bill of Rights agree that all men are born free and equal, and one or the other branch of that declaration has afforded the answer to the [207] question why possession should be protected from that day to this.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Kant and Hegel start from freedom.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The freedom of the will, Kant said, is the essence of man.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is an end in itself; it is that which needs no further explanation, which is absolutely to be respected, and which it is the very end and object of all government to realize and affirm.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Possession is to be protected because a man by taking possession of an object has brought it within the sphere of his will.,1,1,1,1,0,0
He has extended his personality into or over that object.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"As Hegel would have said, possession is the objective realization of free will.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And by Kant's postulate, the will of any individual thus manifested is entitled to absolute respect from every other individual, and can only be overcome or set aside by the universal will, that is, by the state, acting through its organs, the courts.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Savigny did not follow Kant on this point.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"He said that every act of violence is unlawful, and seemed to consider protection of possession a branch of protection to the person.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ But to this it was answered that possession was protected against disturbance by fraud as well as by force, and his view is discredited.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Those who have been contented with humble grounds of expediency seem to have been few in number, and have recanted or are out of favor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The majority have followed in the direction pointed out by Kant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bruns, an admirable writer, expresses a characteristic yearning of the German mind, when he demands an internal juristic necessity drawn from the nature of possession itself, and therefore rejects empirical reasons.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ He finds the necessity he seeks in the freedom of the human will, which the whole legal system does but recognize [208] and carry out.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"Constraint of it is a wrong, which must be righted without regard to conformity of the will to law, and so on in a Kantian vein.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ So Gans, a favorite disciple of Hegel, The will is of itself a substantial thing to be protected, and this individual will has only to yield to the higher common will.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ So Puchta, a great master, The will which wills itself, that is, the recognition of its own personality, is to be protected.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ The chief variation from this view is that of Windscheid, a writer now in vogue.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He prefers the other branch of the declaration in the Bill of Rights.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He thinks that the protection to possession stands on the same grounds as protection against injuria, that every one is the equal of every other in the state, and that no one shall raise himself over the other.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"/4/ Ihering, to be sure, a man of genius, took an independent start, and said that possession is ownership on the defensive; and that, in favor of the owner, he who is exercising ownership in fact (i. e. the possessor) is freed from the necessity of proving title against one who is in an unlawful position.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But to this it was well answered by Bruns, in his later work, that it assumes the title of disseisors to be generally worse than that of disseisees, which cannot be taken for granted, and which probably is not true in fact.",1,1,1,0,1,0
"/5/ It follows from the Kantian doctrine, that a man in possession is to be confirmed and maintained in it until he is put out by an action brought for the purpose.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Perhaps [209] another fact besides those which have been mentioned has influenced this reasoning, and that is the accurate division between possessory and petitory actions or defences in Continental procedure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ When a defendant in a possessory action is not allowed to set up title in himself, a theorist readily finds a mystical importance in possession.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But when does a man become entitled to this absolute protection?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the principle of Kant, it is not enough that he has the custody of a thing.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"A protection based on the sacredness of man's personality requires that the object should have been brought within the sphere of that personality, that the free will should have unrestrainedly set itself into that object.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"There must be then an intent to appropriate it, that is, to make it part of one's self, or one's own.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Here the prevailing view of the Roman law comes in to fortify principle with precedent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are told that, of the many who might have the actual charge or custody of a thing, the Roman law recognized as possessor only the owner, or one holding as owner and on his way to become one by lapse of time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In later days it made a few exceptions on practical grounds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But beyond the pledgee and the sequester (a receiver appointed by the court) these exceptions are unimportant and disputed.,1,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ Some of the Roman jurists state in terms that depositaries and borrowers have not possession of the things intrusted to them.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ Whether the German interpretation of the sources goes too far or not, it must be taken account of in the examination of German theories.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"[210] Philosophy by denying possession to bailees in general cunningly adjusted itself to the Roman law, and thus put itself in a position to claim the authority of that law for the theory of which the mode of dealing with bailees was merely a corollary.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence I say that it is important to show that a far more developed, more rational, and mightier body of law than the Roman, gives no sanction to either premise or conclusion as held by Kant and his successors.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"In the first place, the English law has always had the good sense /1/ to allow title to be set up in defence to a possessory action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the assize of novel disseisin, which which was a true possessory action, the defendant could always rely on his title.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"/2/ Even when possession is taken or kept in a way which is punished by the criminal law, as in case of forcible entry and detainer, proof of title allows the defendant to retain it, and in many cases has been held an answer to an action of trespass.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So in trespass for taking goods the defendant may set up title in himself.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"There might seem to be a trace of the distinction in the general rule, that the title cannot be tried in trespass quare clausum.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But this is an exception commonly put on the ground that the judgment cannot change the property, as trespass for chattels or trover can.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ The rule that you cannot go into title in a possessory action presupposes great difficulty in the proof, the probatio diabolica of the Canon law, delays in the process, and importance of possession [211] ad interim,--all of which mark a stage of society which has long been passed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, it is about as easy and cheap to prove at least a prima facie title as it is to prove possession.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the next place, and this was the importance of the last Lecture to this subject, the common law has always given the possessory remedies to all bailees without exception.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The right to these remedies extends not only to pledgees, lessees, and those having a lien, who exclude their bailor, but to simple bailees, as they have been called, who have no interest in the chattels, no right of detention as against the owner, and neither give nor receive a reward.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ Modern German statutes have followed in the same path so far as to give the possessory remedies to tenants and some others.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Bruns says, as the spirit of the Kantian theory required him to say, that this is a sacrifice of principle to convenience.",1,1,1,1,1,1
/2/ But I cannot see what is left of a principle which avows itself inconsistent with convenience and the actual course of legislation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The first call of a theory of law is that it should fit the facts.,1,0,0,0,0,0
It must explain the observed course of legislation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And as it is pretty certain that men will make laws which seem to them convenient without troubling themselves very much what principles are encountered by their legislation, a principle which defies convenience is likely to wait some time before it finds itself permanently realized.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It remains, then, to seek for some ground for the protection of possession outside the Bill of Rights or the Declaration of Independence, which shall be consistent with the larger scope given to the conception in modern law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
[212] The courts have said but little on the subject.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was laid down in one case that it was an extension of the protection which the law throws around the person, and on that ground held that trespass quare clausum did not pass to an assignee in bankruptcy.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ So it has been said, that to deny a bankrupt trover against strangers for goods coming to his possession after his bankruptcy would be an invitation to all the world to scramble for the possession of them; and reference was made to grounds of policy and convenience.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ I may also refer to the cases of capture, some of which will be cited again.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the Greenland whale-fishery, by the English custom, if the first striker lost his hold on the fish, and it was then killed by another, the first had no claim; but he had the whole if he kept fast to the whale until it was struck by the other, although it then broke from the first harpoon.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"By the custom in the Gallipagos, on the other hand, the first striker had half the whale, although control of the line was lost.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ Each of these customs has been sustained and acted on by the English courts, and Judge Lowell has decided in accordance with still a third, which gives the whale to the vessel whose iron first remains in it, provided claim be made before cutting in.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/4/ The ground as put by Lord Mansfield is simply that, were it not for such customs, there must be a sort of warfare perpetually subsisting between the adventurers.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/5/ If courts adopt different rules on similar facts, according to the point at which men will fight in the [213] several cases, it tends, so far as it goes, to shake an a priori theory of the matter.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Those who see in the history of law the formal expression of the development of society will be apt to think that the proximate ground of law must be empirical, even when that ground is the fact that a certain ideal or theory of government is generally entertained.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Law, being a practical thing, must found itself on actual forces.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is quite enough, therefore, for the law, that man, by an instinct which he shares with the domestic dog, and of which the seal gives a most striking example, will not allow himself to be dispossessed, either by force or fraud, of what he holds, without trying to get it back again.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"/1/ Philosophy may find a hundred reasons to justify the instinct, but it would be totally immaterial if it should condemn it and bid us surrender without a murmur.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As long as the instinct remains, it will be more comfortable for the law to satisfy it in an orderly manner, than to leave people to themselves.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If it should do otherwise, it would become a matter for pedagogues, wholly devoid of reality.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I think we are now in a position to begin the analysis of possession.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It will be instructive to say a word in the first place upon a preliminary question which has been debated with much zeal in Germany.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Is possession a fact or a right?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This question must be taken to mean, by possession and right, what the law means by those words, and not something else which philosophers or moralists may mean by them; for as lawyers we have nothing to do with either, except in a legal sense.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If this had always been borne steadily in mind, the question would hardly have been asked.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"[214] A legal right is nothing but a permission to exercise certain natural powers, and upon certain conditions to obtain protection, restitution, or compensation by the aid of the public force.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Just so far as the aid of the public force is given a man, he has a legal right, and this right is the same whether his claim is founded in righteousness or iniquity.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"Just so far as possession is protected, it is as much a source of legal rights as ownership is when it secures the same protection.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Every right is a consequence attached by the law to one or more facts which the law defines, and wherever the law gives any one special rights not shared by the body of the people, it does so on the ground that certain special facts, not true of the rest of the world, are true of him.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"When a group of facts thus singled out by the law exists in the case of a given person, he is said to be entitled to the corresponding rights; meaning, thereby, that the law helps him to constrain his neighbors, or some of them, in a way in which it would not, if all the facts in question were not true of him.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence, any word which denotes such a group of facts connotes the rights attached to it by way of legal consequences, and any word which denotes the rights attached to a group of facts connotes the group of facts in like manner.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The word possession denotes such a group of facts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence, when we say of a man that he has possession, we affirm directly that all the facts of a certain group are true of him, and we convey indirectly or by implication that the law will give him the advantage of the situation.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"Contract, or property, or any other substantive notion of the law, may be analyzed in the same way, and should be treated in the same order.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The only difference is, that, [215] while possession denotes the facts and connotes the consequence, property always, and contract with more uncertainty and oscillation, denote the consequence and connote the facts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When we say that a man owns a thing, we affirm directly that he has the benefit of the consequences attached to a certain group of facts, and, by implication, that the facts are true of him.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The important thing to grasp is, that each of these legal compounds, possession, property, and contract, is to be analyzed into fact and right, antecedent and consequent, in like manner as every other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is wholly immaterial that one element is accented by one word, and the other by the other two.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are not studying etymology, but law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There are always two things to be asked: first, what are the facts which make up the group in question; and then, what are the consequences attached by the law to that group.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The former generally offers the only difficulties.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence, it is almost tautologous to say that the protection which the law attaches by way of consequence to possession, is as truly a right in a legal sense as those consequences which are attached to adverse holding for the period of prescription, or to a promise for value or under seal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the statement is aided by dramatic reinforcement, I may add that possessory rights pass by descent or devise, as well as by conveyance, /1/ and that they are taxed as property in some of the States.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ We are now ready to analyze possession as understood by the common law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In order to discover the facts which constitute it, it will be found best to study them at the moment when possession is first gained.",1,0,0,0,0,0
For then they must [216] all be present in the same way that both consideration and promise must be present at the moment of making a contract.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when we turn to the continuance of possessory rights, or, as is commonly said, the continuance of possession, it will be agreed by all schools that less than all the facts required to call those rights into being need continue presently true in order to keep them alive.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"To gain possession, then, a man must stand in a certain physical relation to the object and to the rest of the world, and must have a certain intent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These relations and this intent are the facts of which we are in search.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The physical relation to others is simply a relation of manifested power coextensive with the intent, and will need to have but little said about it when the nature of the intent is settled.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"When I come to the latter, I shall not attempt a similar analysis to that which has been pursued with regard to intent as an element of liability.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For the principles developed as to intent in that connection have no relation to the present subject, and any such analysis so far as it did not fail would be little more than a discussion of evidence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The intent inquired into here must be overtly manifested, perhaps, but all theories of the grounds on which possession is protected would seem to agree in leading to the requirement that it should be actual, subject, of course, to the necessary limits of legal investigation.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But, besides our power and intent as towards our fellow-men, there must be a certain degree of power over the object.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If there were only one other man in the world, and he was safe under lock and key in jail, the person having the key would not possess the swallows that flew over the prison.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This element is illustrated by cases of capture, [217] although no doubt the point at which the line is drawn is affected by consideration of the degree of power obtained as against other people, as well as by that which has been gained over the object.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Roman and the common law agree that, in general, fresh pursuit of wild animals does not give the pursuer the rights of possession.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Until escape has been made impossible by some means, another may step in and kill or catch and carry off the game if he can.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Thus it has been held that an action does not lie against a person for killing and taking a fox which had been pursued by another, and was then actually in the view of the person who had originally found, started, and chased it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ The Court of Queen's Bench even went so far as to decide, notwithstanding a verdict the other way, that when fish were nearly surrounded by a seine, with an opening of seven fathoms between the ends, at which point boats were stationed to frighten them from escaping, they were not reduced to possession as against a stranger who rowed in through the opening and helped himself.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ But the difference between the power over the object which is sufficient for possession, and that which is not, is clearly one of degree only, and the line may be drawn at different places at different times on grounds just referred to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thus we are told that the legislature of New York enacted, in 1844, that any one who started and pursued deer in certain counties of that State should be deemed in possession of the game so long as he continued in fresh pursuit of it, /3/ and to that extent modified the New York decisions just cited.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"So, while Justinian decided that a wild beast so [218] badly wounded that it might easily be taken must be actually taken before it belongs to the captors, /1/ Judge Lowell, with equal reason, has upheld the contrary custom of the American whalemen in the Arctic Ocean, mentioned above, which gives a whale to the vessel whose iron first remains in it, provided claim be made before cutting in.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ We may pass from the physical relation to the object with these few examples, because it cannot often come into consideration except in the case of living and wild things.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And so we come to the intent, which is the really troublesome matter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is just here that we find the German jurists unsatisfactory, for reasons which I have already explained.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The best known theories have been framed as theories of the German interpretation of the Roman law, under the influence of some form of Kantian or post-Kantian philosophy.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The type of Roman possession, according to German opinion, was that of an owner, or of one on his way to become owner.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Following this out, it was said by Savigny, the only writer on the subject with whom English readers are generally acquainted, that the animus domini, or intent to deal with the thing as owner, is in general necessary to turn a mere physical detention into juridical possession.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ We need not stop to inquire whether this modern form or the [Greek characters] (animus dominantis, animus dominandi) of Theophilus /4/ and the Greek sources is more exact; for either excludes, as the civilians and canonists do, and as the [219] German theories must, most bailees and termors from the list of possessors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ The effect of this exclusion as interpreted by the Kantian philosophy of law, has been to lead the German lawyers to consider the intent necessary to possession as primarily self-regarding.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Their philosophy teaches them that a man's physical power over an object is protected because he has the will to make it his, and it has thus become a part of his very self, the external manifestation of his freedom.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ The will of the possessor being thus conceived as self-regarding, the intent with which he must hold is pretty clear: he must hold for his own benefit.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"Furthermore, the self-regarding intent must go to the height of an intent to appropriate; for otherwise, it seems to be implied, the object would not truly be brought under the personality of the possessor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The grounds for rejecting the criteria of the Roman law have been shown above.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let us begin afresh.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Legal duties are logically antecedent to legal rights.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"What may be their relation to moral rights if there are any, and whether moral rights are not in like manner logically the offspring of moral duties, are questions which do not concern us here.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"These are for the philosopher, who approaches the law from without as part of a larger series of human manifestations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The business of the jurist is to make known the content of the law; that is, to work upon it from within, or logically, arranging and distributing it, in order, from its stemmum genus to its infima species, so far as practicable.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Legal duties then come before legal [220] rights.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To put it more broadly, and avoid the word duty, which is open to objection, the direct working of the law is to limit freedom of action or choice on the part of a greater or less number of persons in certain specified ways; while the power of removing or enforcing this limitation which is generally confided to certain other private persons, or, in other words, a right corresponding to the burden, is not a necessary or universal correlative.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, a large part of the advantages enjoyed by one who has a right are not created by the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The law does not enable me to use or abuse this book which lies before me.,1,0,0,0,0,0
That is a physical power which I have without the aid of the law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
What the law does is simply to prevent other men to a greater or less extent from interfering with my use or abuse.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And this analysis and example apply to the case of possession, as well as to ownership.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Such being the direct working of the law in the case of possession, one would think that the animus or intent most nearly parallel to its movement would be the intent of which we are in search.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If what the law does is to exclude others from interfering with the object, it would seem that the intent which the law should require is an intent to exclude others.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I believe that such an intent is all that the common law deems needful, and that on principle no more should be required.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It may be asked whether this is not simply the animus domini looked at from the other side.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it were, it would nevertheless be better to look at the front of the shield than at the reverse.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is not the same if we give to the animus domini the meaning which the Germans give it, and which denies possession to bailees in general.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The intent to appropriate or deal with a thing as owner can [221] hardly exist without an intent to exclude others, and something more; but the latter may very well be where there is no intent to hold as owner.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A tenant for years intends to exclude all persons, including the owner, until the end of his term; yet he has not the animus domini in the sense explained.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Still less has a bailee with a lien, who does not even mean to use, but only to detain the thing for payment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, further, the common law protects a bailee against strangers, when it would not protect him against the owner, as in the case of a deposit or other bailment terminable at pleasure; and we may therefore say that the intent even to exclude need not be so extensive as would be implied in the animus domini.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If a bailee intends to exclude strangers to the title, it is enough for possession under our law, although he is perfectly ready to give the thing up to its owner at any moment; while it is of the essence of the German view that the intent must not be relative, but an absolute, self-regarding intent to take the benefit of the thing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, if the motives or wishes, and even the intentions, most present to the mind of a possessor, were all self-regarding, it would not follow that the intent toward others was not the important thing in the analysis of the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, as we have seen, a depositary is a true possessor under the common-law theory, although his intent is not self-regarding, and he holds solely for the benefit of the owner.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"There is a class of cases besides those of bailees and tenants, which will probably, although not necessarily, be decided one way or the other, as we adopt the test of an intent to exclude, or of the animus domini.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Bridges v. Hawkesworth /1/ will serve as a starting-point.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"There, [222] a pocket-book was dropped on the floor of a shop by a customer, and picked up by another customer before the shopkeeper knew of it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Common-law judges and civilians would agree that the finder got possession first, and so could keep it as against the shopkeeper.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For the shopkeeper, not knowing of the thing, could not have the intent to appropriate it, and, having invited the public to his shop, he could not have the intent to exclude them from it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But suppose the pocket-book had been dropped in a private room, how should the case be decided?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There can be no animus domini unless the thing is known of; but an intent to exclude others from it may be contained in the larger intent to exclude others from the place where it is, without any knowledge of the object's existence.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In McAvoy v. Medina, /1/ a pocket-book had been left upon a barber's table, and it was held that the barber had a better right than the finder.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The opinion is rather obscure.,0,0,0,0,0,0

It will be remembered that the earliest appearance of law was as a substitute for the private feuds between families or clans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But while a defendant who did not peaceably submit to the jurisdiction of the court might be put outside the protection of the law, so that any man might kill him at sight, there was at first [249] no way of securing the indemnity to which the plaintiff was entitled unless the defendant chose to give such security.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"For to explain how mankind first learned to promise, we must go to metaphysics, and find out how it ever came to frame a future tense.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"But the history of the action of debt is instructive, although in a humbler way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is necessary to know something about it in order to understand the enlightened rules which make up the law of contract at the present time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In Glanvill's treatise the action of debt is found already to be one of the well-known remedies.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the law of those days was still in a somewhat primitive state, and it will easily be imagined that a form of action which goes back as far as that was not founded on any very delicate discriminations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was, as I shall try to show directly, simply the general form in which any money claim was collected, except unliquidated claims for damages by force, for which there was established the equally general remedy of trespass.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It has been thought that the action was adopted from the then more civilized procedure of the Roman law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A [252] natural opinion, seeing that all the early English law-writers adopt their phraseology and classification from Rome.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Still it seems much more probable that the action is of pure German descent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has the features of the primitive procedure which is found upon the Continent, as described by Laband.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ The substance of the plaintiff's claim as set forth in the writ of debt is that the defendant owes him so much and wrongfully withholds it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"It does not matter, for a claim framed like that, how the defendant's duty arises.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is not confined to contract.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is satisfied if there is a duty to pay on any ground.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It states a mere conclusion of law, not the facts upon which that conclusion is based, and from which the liability arises.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The old German complaint was, in like manner, A owes me so much.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was characteristic of the German procedure that the defendant could meet that complaint by answering, in an equally general form, that he did not owe the plaintiff.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The plaintiff had to do more than simply allege a debt, if he would prevent the defendant from escaping in that way.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"In England, if the plaintiff had not something to show for his debt, the defendant's denial turned him out of court; and even if he had, he was liable to be defeated by the defendant's swearing with some of his friends to back him that he owed nothing.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The chief reason why debt was supplanted for centuries by a later remedy, assumpsit, was the survival of this relic of early days.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Finally, in England as in Germany, debt for the detention of money was the twin brother of the action brought for wrongfully withholding any other kind of chattel.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The gist of the complaint in either case was the same.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It seems strange that this crude product of the infancy of law should have any importance for us at the present time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Yet whenever we trace a leading doctrine of substantive law far enough back, we are very likely to find some forgotten circumstance of procedure at its source.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Illustrations of this truth have been given already.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The action of debt and the other actions of contract will furnish others.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Debt throws most light upon the doctrine of consideration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Our law does not enforce every promise which a man may make.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Promises made as ninety-nine promises out of a hundred are, by word of mouth or simple writing, are not binding unless there is a consideration for them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"That is, as it is commonly explained, unless the promisee has either conferred a benefit on the promisor, or incurred a detriment, as the inducement to the promise.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been thought that this rule was borrowed from Roman law by the Chancery, and, after undergoing some modification there, passed into the common law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But this account of the matter is at least questionable.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So far as the use of words goes, I am not aware that consideration is distinctly called cause before the reign of Elizabeth; in the earlier reports it always appears as quid pro quo.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Its first appearance, so far as I know, is in Fleta's account of the action of debt, /1/ and although I am inclined to believe that Fleta's statement is not to be trusted, a careful consideration of the chronological order of the cases in the Year Books will show, I think, that the doctrine was fully developed in debt before any mention of it in equity can be found.",1,0,0,0,0,0
One of the earliest [254] references to what a promisor was to have for his undertaking was in the action of assumpsit.,0,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ But the doctrine certainly did not originate there.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The first mention of consideration in connection with equity which I have seen is in the form of quid pro quo, /2/ and occurs after the requirement had been thoroughly established in debt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ The single fact that a consideration was never required for contracts under seal, unless Fleta is to be trusted against the great weight of nearly contemporaneous evidence, goes far to show that the rule cannot have originated on grounds of policy as a rule of substantive law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And conversely, the coincidence of the doctrine with a peculiar mode of procedure points very strongly to the probability that the peculiar requirement and the peculiar procedure were connected.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will throw light on the question to put together a few undisputed facts, and to consider what consequences naturally followed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It will therefore be desirable to examine the action of debt a little further.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it is only fair to admit, at the outset, that I offer the explanation which follows with great hesitation, and, I think, with a full appreciation of the objections which might be urged.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It was observed a moment ago, that, in order to recover against a defendant who denied his debt, the plaintiff had to show something for it; otherwise he was turned over to the limited jurisdiction of the spiritual tribunals.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/4/ This requirement did not mean evidence in the modern sense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It meant simply that he must maintain his cause in one of the ways then recognized by law.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"These were three, the [255] duel, a writing, and witnesses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The duel need not be discussed, as it soon ceased to be used in debt, and has no bearing on what I have to say.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Trial by writing and by witnesses, on the other hand, must both be carefully studied.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It will be convenient to consider the latter first and to find out what these witnesses were.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One thing we know at the start; they were not witnesses as we understand the term.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"They were not produced before a jury for examination and cross-examination, nor did their testimony depend for its effect on being believed by the court that heard it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Nowadays, a case is not decided by the evidence, but by a verdict, or a finding of facts, followed by a judgment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The oath of a witness has no effect unless it is believed.,1,0,0,0,0,0
But in the time of Henry II.,0,0,0,0,0,0
our trial by jury did not exist.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When an oath was allowed to be sworn it had the same effect, whether it was believed or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
There was no provision for sifting it by a second body.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In those cases where a trial by witnesses was possible, if the party called on to go forward could find a certain number of men who were willing to swear in a certain form, there was an end of the matter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now this seems like a more primitive way of establishing a debt than the production of the defendant's written acknowledgement, and it is material to discover its origin.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The cases in which this mode of trial was used appear from the early books and reports to have been almost wholly confined to claims arising out of a sale or loan.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And the question at once occurs, whether we are not upon traces of an institution which was already ancient when Glanvill wrote.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For centuries before the Conquest Anglo-Saxon law /1/ had required the election of a certain [256] number of official witnesses, two or three of whom were to be called in to every bargain of sale.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The object for which these witnesses were established is not commonly supposed to have been the proof of debts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They go back to a time when theft and similar offences were the chief ground of litigation, and the purpose for which they were appointed was to afford a means of deciding whether a person charged with having stolen property had come by it rightfully or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
A defendant could clear himself of the felony by their oath that he had bought or received the thing openly in the way appointed by law.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Having been present at the bargain, the witnesses were able to swear to what they had seen and heard, if any question arose between the parties.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Accordingly, their use was not confined to disposing of a charge of felony.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But that particular service identifies the transaction witnesses of the Saxon period.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Now we know that the use of these witnesses did not at once disappear under Norman influence.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They are found with their old function in the laws of William the Conqueror.,1,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ The language of Glanvill seems to prove that they were still known under Henry II.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"He says that, if a purchaser cannot summon in the man from whom he bought, to warrant the property to him and defend the suit, (for if he does, the peril is shifted to the seller,) then if the purchaser has sufficient proof of his having lawfully bought the thing, de legittimo marcatu suo, it will clear him of felony.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"But if he have not sufficient suit, he will be in danger.",1,1,0,1,1,0
/2/ This is the law of William over again.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It follows that purchasers still used the transaction witnesses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But Glanvill also seems to admit the use of witness to establish debts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ As the transaction witnesses were formerly available for this purpose, I see no reason to doubt that they still were, and that he is speaking of them here also.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ Moreover, for a long time after Henry II., whenever an action was brought for a debt of which there was no written evidence, the plaintiff, when asked what he had to show for it, always answered good suit, and tendered his witnesses, who were sometimes examined by the court.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"/3/ I think it is not straining the evidence to infer that the good suit of the later reports was the descendant of the Saxon transaction witnesses, as it has been shown that Glanvill's secta was.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/4/ Assuming this step in the argument to have been taken, it will be well to recall again for a moment the original nature of the witness oath.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It was confined to facts within the witnesses' knowledge by sight and hearing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as the purposes for which witnesses were provided only required their presence when property changed hands, the principal case in which they could be of service between the parties [258] to a bargain was when a debt was claimed by reason of the delivery of property.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The purpose did not extend to agreements which were executory on both sides, because there no question of theft could arise.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And Glanvill shows that in his time the King's Court did not enforce such agreements.,1,1,1,0,1,0
"/1/ Now, if the oath of the secta could only be used to establish a debt where the transaction witnesses could have sworn, it will be seen, readily enough, how an accident of procedure may have led to a most important rule of substantive law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The rule that witnesses could only swear to facts within their knowledge, coupled with the accident that these witnesses were not used in transactions which might create a debt, except for a particular fact, namely, the delivery of property, together with the further accident that this delivery was quid pro quo, was equivalent to the rule that, when a debt was proved by witnesses there must be quid pro quo.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But these debts proved by witnesses, instead of by deed are what we call simple contract debts, and thus beginning with debt, and subsequently extending itself to other contracts, is established our peculiar and most important doctrine that every simple contract must have a consideration.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This was never the law as to debts or contracts proved in the usual way by the defendant's seal, and the fact that it applied only to obligations which were formerly established by a procedure of limited use, [259] goes far to show that the connection with procedure was not accidental.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The mode of proof soon changed, but as late as the reign of Queen Elizabeth we find a trace of this original connection.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is said, But the common law requires that there should be a new cause (i. e. consideration), whereof the country may have intelligence or knowledge for the trial of it, if need be, so that it is necessary for the Public-weal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Lord Mansfield showed his intuition of the historical grounds of our law when he said, I take it that the ancient notion about the want of consideration was for the sake of evidence only; for when it is reduced into writing, as in covenants, specialties, bonds, etc., there was no objection to the want of consideration.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ If it should be objected that the preceding argument is necessarily confined to debt, whereas the requirement of consideration applies equally to all simple contracts, the answer is, that in all probability the rule originated with debt, and spread from debt to other contracts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, again, it may be asked whether there were no other contracts proved by witness except those which have been mentioned.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Were there no contracts proved in that way to which the accidental consideration was wanting?,0,0,0,0,0,0
To this also there is an easy answer.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The contracts enforced by the civil courts, even as late as Henry II., were few and simple.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The witness procedure was no doubt broad enough for all the contracts which were made in early times.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Besides those of sale, loan, and the like, which have been mentioned, I find but two contractual [260] obligations.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These were the warranties accompanying a sale and suretyship which was referred to at the beginning of the Lecture.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of the former, warranty of title was rather regarded as an obligation raised by the law out of the relation of buyer and seller than as a contract.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Other express warranties were matters within the knowledge of the transaction witnesses, and were sworn to by them in Saxon times.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ But in the Norman period warranty is very little heard of, except with regard to land, and then it was decided by the duel.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It so wholly disappeared, except where it was embodied in a deed, that it can have had no influence upon the law of consideration.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I shall therefore assume, without more detail, that it does not bear upon the case.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Then as to the pledge or surety.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He no longer paid with his body, unless in very exceptional cases, but his liability was translated into money, and enforced in an action of debt.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"This time-honored contract, like the other debts of Glanvill's time, could be established by witness without a writing, /2/ and in this case there was not such a consideration, such a benefit to the promisor, as the law required when the doctrine was first enunciated.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But this also is unimportant, because his liability on the oath of witness came to an end, as well as that of the warrantor, before the foundations were laid for the rule which I am seeking to explain.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A writing soon came to be required, as will be seen in a moment.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The result so far is, that the only action of contract in Glanvill's time was debt, that the only debts recovered [261] without writing were those which have been described, and that the only one of these for which there was not quid pro quo ceased to be recoverable in that way by the reign of Edward III.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But great changes were beginning in the reign of Henry II.,0,0,0,0,0,0
More various and complex contracts soon came to be enforced.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be asked, Why was not the scope of the witness oath enlarged, or, if any better proof were forthcoming, why was not the secta done away with, and other oral testimony admitted?",0,0,0,0,0,0

"'s time have to do with consideration, which not heard of until centuries later?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is manifest that a witness oath, which disposes of a case by the simple fact that it is sworn, is not a satisfactory mode of proof.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A written admission of debt produced in court, and sufficiently identified as issuing from the defendant, is obviously much better.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The only weak point about a writing is the means of identifying it as the defendant's, and this difficulty disappeared as soon as the use of seals became common.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This had more or less taken place in Glanvill's time, and then all that a party had to do was to produce the writing and satisfy the court by inspection that the impression on the wax fitted his opponent's seal.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"/1/ The oath of the secta could always be successfully met by wager of law, /2/ that is, by a counter oath the part of the defendant, with the same or double the number of fellow-swearers produced by the plaintiff.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But a writing proved to be the defendant's could not be contradicted.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[262] /1/ For if a man said he was bound, he was bound.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"There was no question of consideration, because there was as yet no such doctrine.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"He was equally bound if he acknowledged all obligation in any place having a record, such as the superior courts, by which his acknowledgment could be proved.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"Indeed, to this day some securities are taken simply by an oral admission before the clerk of a court noted by him in his papers.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"The advantage of the writing was not only that it furnished better proof in the old cases, but also that it made it possible to enforce obligations for which there would otherwise have been no proof at all.",1,0,0,0,0,0
What has been said sufficiently explains the preference of proof by writing to proof by the old-fashioned witness oath.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But there were other equally good reasons why the latter should not be extended beyond its ancient limits.,1,0,0,0,0,0
The transaction witnesses were losing their statutory and official character.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Already in Glanvill's time the usual modes of proving a debt were by the duel or by writing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ A hundred years later Bracton shows that the secta had degenerated to the retainers and household of the party, and he says that their oath raises but a slight presumption.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ Moreover, a new mode of trial was growing up, which, although it was not made use of in these cases /4/ for a good while, must have tended to diminish the estimate set on the witness oath by contrast.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This was the beginning of our trial by jury.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was at first an inquest of the neighbors [263] most likely to know about a disputed matter of fact.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They spoke from their own knowledge, but they were selected by an officer of the court instead of by the interested party, and were intended to be impartial.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Soon witnesses were summoned before them, not, as of old, to the case by their oath, but to aid the inquest to find a verdict by their testimony.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"With the advent of this enlightened procedure, the secta soon ceased to decide the case, and it may well be asked why it did not disappear and leave no traces.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Taking into account the conservatism of the English law, and the fact that, before deeds came in, the only debts for which there had been a remedy were debts proved by the transaction witnesses, it would not have been a surprise to find the tender of suit persisting in those cases.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But there was another reason still more imperative.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The defence in debt where there was no deed was by wager of law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ A section of Magna Charta was interpreted to prohibit a man's being put to his law on the plaintiff's own statement without good witness.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"/3/ Hence, the statute required witness--that is, the secta--in every case of debt where the plaintiff did not rely upon a writing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Thus it happened that suit continued to be tendered in those cases where it had been of old, /4/ and as the defendant, if he did not admit the debt in such cases, always waged his law, it was long before the inquest got much foothold.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"To establish a debt which arose merely by way of promise or acknowledgment, and for which there had formerly [264] been no mode of trial provided, you must have a writing, the new form of proof which introduced it into the law.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The rule was laid down, by parol the party is not obliged.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ But the old debts were not conceived of as raised by a promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ They were a duty springing from the plaintiff's receipt of property, a fact which could be seen and sworn to.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In these cases the old law maintained and even extended itself a little by strict analogy.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the undertaking of a surety, in whatever form it was clothed, did not really arise out of any such fact.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It had become of the same nature as other promises, and it was soon doubted whether it should not be proved by the same evidence.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ By the reign of Edward III., it was settled that a deed was necessary, /4/ except where the customs of particular cities had kept the old law in force.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/5/ This reign may be taken as representing the time when the divisions and rules of procedure were established which have lasted until the present day.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is therefore worth while to repeat and sum up the condition of the law at that time.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It was still necessary that the secta should be tendered in every action of debt for which no writing was produced.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For this, as well as for the other reasons which have been mentioned, the sphere of such actions was not materially enlarged beyond those cases which had formerly been established by the witness-oath.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As suretyship was no [265] longer one of these, they became strictly limited to cases in which the debt arose from the receipt of a quid pro quo.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Moreover there was no other action of contract which could be maintained without a writing.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"New species of contracts were now enforced by an action of covenant, but there a deed was always necessary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"At the same time the secta had shrunk to a form, although it was still argued that its function was more important in contract than elsewhere.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It could no longer be examined before the court.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ It was a mere survival, and the transaction witness had ceased to be an institution.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence, the necessity of tendering the witness oath did not fix the limit of debt upon simple contract except by tradition, and it is not surprising to find that the action was slightly extended by analogy from its scope in Glanvill's time.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But debt remained substantially at the point which I have indicated, and no new action available for simple contracts was introduced for a century.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the mean time the inversion which I have explained took place, and what was an accident of procedure had become a doctrine of substantive law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The change was easy when the debts which could be enforced without deed all sprung from a benefit to the debtor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The influence of the Roman law, no doubt, aided in bringing about this result.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It will be remembered that in the reign of Henry II.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"most simple contracts and debts for which there was not the evidence of deed or witness were left to be enforced by the ecclesiastical courts, so far as their jurisdiction extended.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ Perhaps it was this circumstance [266] which led Glanvill and his successors to apply the terminology of the civilians to common-law debts.,1,1,1,0,1,0
"But whether he borrowed it from the ecclesiastical courts, or went directly to the fountain-head, certain it is that Glanvill makes use of the classification and technical language of the Corpus Juris throughout his tenth book.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"There were certain special contracts in the Roman system called real, which bound the contractor either to return a certain thing put into his hands by the contractee, as in a case of lease or loan, or to deliver other articles of the same kind, as when grain, oil, or money was lent.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"This class did not correspond, except in the most superficial way, with the common-law debts.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But Glanvill adopted the nomenclature, and later writers began to draw conclusions from it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The author of Fleta, a writer by no means always intelligent in following and adopting his predecessors' use of the Roman law, /1/ says that to raise a debt there must be not only a certain thing promised, but a certain thing promised in return.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ If Fleta had confined his statement to debts by simple contract, it might well have been suggested by the existing state of the law.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But as he also required a writing and a seal, in addition to the matter given or promised in return, the doctrine laid down by him can hardly have prevailed at any time.",1,1,0,1,1,0
It was probably nothing more than a slight vagary of reasoning based upon the Roman elements which he borrowed from Bracton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
[267] It only remains to trace the gradual appearance of consideration in the decisions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A case of the reign of Edward III.,0,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ seems to distinguish between a parol obligation founded on voluntary payments by the obligee and one founded on a payment at the obligor's request.,1,0,0,0,0,0
It also speaks of the debt or duty in that case as arising by cause of payments.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Somewhat similar language is used in the next reign.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ So, in the twelfth year of Henry IV., /3/ there is an approach to the thought: If money is promised to a man for making a release, and he makes the release, he will have a good action of debt in the matter.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the next reign /4/ it was decided that, in such a case, the plaintiff could not recover without having executed the release, which is explained by the editor on the ground that ex nudo pacto non oritur actio.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the most important fact is, that from Edward I. to Henry VI.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"we find no case where a debt was recovered, unless a consideration had in fact been received.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Another fact to be noticed is, that since Edward III.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"debts arising from a transaction without writing are said to arise from contract, as distinguished from debts arising from an obligation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/5/ Hence, when consideration was required as such, it was required in contracts not under seal, whether debts or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Under Henry VI.,0,0,0,0,0,0
quid pro quo became a necessity in all such contracts.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the third year of that reign /6/ it was objected to au action upon an [268] assumpsit for not building a mill, that it was not shown what the defendant was to have for doing it.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"/1/ The case turned upon a question which was debated for centuries before it was settled, whether debt would lie for a sum of money promised by the defendant to the plaintiff if he would marry the defendant's daughter.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"But whereas formerly the debate had been whether the promise was not so far incident to the marriage that it belonged exclusively to the jurisdiction of the spiritual courts, it now touched the purely mundane doubt whether the defendant had had quid pro quo.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Such cases, also, offer the most obvious form of consideration.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The natural question is, what the promisor was to have for his promise.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ It is only by analysis that the supposed policy of the law is seen to be equally satisfied by a detriment incurred by the promisee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It therefore not unnaturally happened that the judges, when they first laid down the law that there must be quid pro quo, were slow to recognize a detriment to the contractee as satisfying the requirement which had been laid down.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In the case which I have mentioned some of the judges were inclined to hold that getting rid of his daughter was a sufficient benefit to the defendant to make him a debtor for the money which he promised; and there was even some hint of the opinion, that marrying the lady was a [269] consideration, because it was a detriment to the promisee.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ But the other opinion prevailed, at least for a time, because the defendant had had nothing from the plaintiff to raise a debt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ So it was held that a service rendered to a third person upon the defendant's request and promise of a reward would not be enough, /3/ although not without strong opinions to the contrary, and for a time the precedents were settled.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It became established law that an action of debt would only lie upon a consideration actually received by and enuring to the benefit of the debtor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was, however, no peculiarity of either the action or contract of debt which led to this view, but the imperfectly developed theory of consideration prevailing between the reigns of Henry VI.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The theory the same in assumpsit, /4/ and in equity.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/5/ Wherever consideration was mentioned, it was always as quid pro quo, as what the contractor was to have for his contract.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Moreover, before consideration was ever heard of, debt was the time-honored remedy on every obligation to pay money enforced by law, except the liability to damages for a wrong.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/6/ It has been shown already that a surety could be sued in debt until the time of Edward III.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"without a writing, yet a surety receives no benefit from the dealing with his principal.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, if a man sells corn to A, [270] and B says, I will pay if A does not, the sale does B no good so far as appears by the terms of the bargain.",1,0,0,0,0,0

It was not always so.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"In that case, it does not matter how the obligation arose, or whether there was any consideration for it or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But a writing was a more general way of establishing a debt in Glanvill's time than witness, and it is absurd to determine the scope of the action by considering only a single class of debts enforced by it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Moreover, a writing for a long time was only another, although more conclusive, mode of proof.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The foundation of the action was the same, however it was proved.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This was a duty or duity /1/ to the plaintiff, in other words, that money was due him, no matter how, as any one may see by reading the earlier Year Books.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Hence it was, that debt lay equally upon a judgment, /2/ which established such a duty by matter of record, or upon the defendant's admission recorded in like manner.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ To sum up, the action of debt has passed through three stages.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"At first, it was the only remedy to recover money due, except when the liability was simply to pay damages for a wrongful act.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It was closely akin to--indeed it was but a branch of--the action for any form of personal property which the defendant was bound by contract or otherwise to hand over to the plaintiff.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/4/ If there was a contract to pay money, the only question was how you [271] could prove it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Any such contract, which could be proved by any of the means known to early law, constituted a debt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There was no theory of consideration, and therefore, of course, no limit to either the action or the contract based upon the nature of the consideration received.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The second stage was when the doctrine of consideration was introduced in its earlier form of a benefit to the promisor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This applied to all contracts not under seal while it prevailed, but it was established while debt was the only action for money payable by such contracts.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The precedents are, for the most part, precedents in debt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The third stage was reached when a larger view was taken of consideration, and it was expressed in terms of detriment to the promisee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This change was a change in substantive law, and logically it should have been applied throughout.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But it arose in another and later form of action, under circumstances peculiarly connected with that action, as will be explained hereafter.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The result was that the new doctrine prevailed in the new action, and the old in the old, and that what was really the anomaly of inconsistent theories carried out side by side disguised itself in the form of a limitation upon the action of debt.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"That action did not remain, as formerly, the remedy for all binding contracts to pay money, but, so far as parol contracts were concerned, could only be used where the consideration was a benefit actually received by the promisor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"With regard to obligations arising in any other way, it has remained unchanged.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I must now devote a few words to the effect upon our law of the other mode of proof which I have mentioned.,1,0,0,0,0,0
I mean charters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A charter was simply a writing.,0,0,0,0,0,0

/1/ With them seals came in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But as late as Henry II.,0,0,0,0,0,0
they were said by the Chief Justice of England to belong properly only to kings and to very great men.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"/4/ It could be waived, and suit tendered in its place.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/5/ Its conclusive effect was due to the satisfactory nature of the evidence, not to the seal.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"Nowadays, it is sometimes thought more philosophical to say that a covenant is a formal contract, which survives alongside of the ordinary consensual contract, just as happened in the Roman law.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"In one sense, everything is form which the law requires in order to make a promise binding over and above the mere expression of the promisor's will.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Consideration is a form as much as a seal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The only difference is, that one form is of modern introduction, and has a foundation in good sense, or at least in with our common habits of thought, so that we do not notice it, whereas the other is a survival from an older condition of the law, and is less manifestly sensible, or less familiar.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I may add, that, under the influence of the latter consideration, the law of covenants is breaking down.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In many States it is held that a mere scroll or flourish of the pen is a sufficient seal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"From this it is a short step to abolish the distinction between sealed and unsealed instruments altogether, and this has been done in some of the Western States.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"[274] While covenants survive in a somewhat weak old age, and debt has disappeared, leaving a vaguely disturbing influence behind it, the whole modern law of contract has grown up through the medium of the action of Assumpsit, which must now be explained.",1,0,0,0,0,0

It could not be committed by one who was in possession himself.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"/1/ But as laming the horse was equally a wrong, whether the owner held the horse by the bridle or left it with the smith, and as the wrong was closely analogous to a trespass, although not one, the law gave the owner a writ of trespass on the case.",1,0,0,0,0,0

Yet in this instance also the judges thought that trespass on the case would lie.,0,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ In the time of Henry IV.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"the action could not have been maintained for a simple refusal to build according to agreement; but it was suggested by the court, that, if the writ had mentioned that the thing had been commenced and then by not done, it would have been otherwise.",1,0,0,0,0,0

The meaning of that analogy is plain.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"This view derives some support from the issue on which the parties went to trial, which was that the defendant performed the cure as well as he knew how, without this, that the horse died for default of his care (cure?).",1,1,1,1,1,1

"This may have led the defendant to adopt the course he did, because he felt uncertain whether any action of tort would lie.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"He took issue on the undertaking, assuming that to be essential to the plaintiff's case, and then objected that the writ did not show the place of the undertaking, and hence was bad, because it did not show whence the inquest should be summoned to speak to that point.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The writ was adjudged bad on that ground, which seems as if the court sanctioned the defendant's view.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"/2/ In the last cited report, although the principal case only laid down a doctrine that would be followed to-day, there was also stated an anonymous case which was interpreted to mean that an executed consideration furnished upon request, but without any promise of any kind, would support a subsequent promise to pay for it.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"It vastly extended the number of actionable contracts, which had formerly been confined to debts and covenants, whereas nearly any promise could be sued in assumpsit; and it introduced a theory which has had great influence on modern law,--that all the liabilities of a bailee are founded on contract.",1,0,0,0,0,0

[289] LECTURE VIII.,0,0,0,0,0,0
THE general method to be pursued in the analysis of contract is the same as that already explained with regard to possession.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Wherever the law gives special rights to one, or imposes special burdens on another, it does so on the ground that certain special facts are true of those individuals.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In all such cases, therefore, there is a twofold task.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"First, to determine what are the facts to which the special consequences are attached; second, to ascertain the consequences.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The first is the main field of legal argument.,0,0,0,0,0,0
With regard to contracts the facts are not always the same.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They may be that a certain person has signed, sealed, and delivered a writing of a certain purport.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They may be that he has made an oral promise, and that the promisee has furnished him a consideration.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"The common element of all contracts might be said to be a promise, although even a promise was not necessary to a liability in debt as formerly understood.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as it will not be possible to discuss covenants further, and as consideration formed the main topic of the last Lecture, I will take up that first.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Furthermore, as there is an historical difference between consideration in debt and in assumpsit, I shall confine myself to the latter, which is the later and more philosophical form.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is said that any benefit conferred by the promisee on the promisor, or any detriment incurred by the promisee, [290] may be a consideration.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is also thought that every consideration may be reduced to a case of the latter sort, using the word detriment in a somewhat broad sense.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"To illustrate the general doctrine, suppose that a man is desirous of having a cask of brandy carried from Boston to Cambridge, and that a truckman, either out of kindness or from some other motive, says that he will carry it, and it is delivered to him accordingly.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If he carelessly staves in the cask, there would perhaps be no need to allege that he undertook to carry it, and on principle, and according to the older cases, if an undertaking was alleged, no consideration for the assumpsit need be stated.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ The ground of complaint in that case would be a wrong, irrespective of contract.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if the complaint was that he did not carry it as agreed, the plaintiff's difficulty would be that the truckman was not bound to do so unless there was a consideration for his promise.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"Suppose, therefore, that it was alleged that he promised to do so in consideration of the delivery to him.",1,1,0,1,1,0
Would this be a sufficient consideration?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The oldest cases, going on the notion of benefit to the promisor, said that it could not be, for it was a trouble, not a benefit.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ Then take it from the side of detriment.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The delivery is a necessary condition to the promisor's doing the kindness, and if he does it, the delivery, so far from being a detriment to the promisee, is a clear benefit to him.",1,1,0,1,1,0
But this argument is a fallacy.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Clearly the delivery would be sufficient consideration to enable the owner to declare in assumpsit for the breach of those duties which [291] arose, irrespective of contract, from the defendant's having undertaken to deal with the thing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ It would be a sufficient consideration for any promise not involving a dealing with the thing for its performance, for instance, to pay a thousand dollars.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ And the law has not pronounced the consideration good or bad according to the nature of the promise founded upon it.,1,0,0,0,0,0

/3/ The argument on the other side leaves out of sight the point of time at which the sufficiency of the consideration is to be determined.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is the moment when the consideration is furnished.,0,0,0,0,0,0
At that moment the delivery of the cask is a detriment in the strictest sense.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The root of the whole matter is the relation of reciprocal [294] conventional inducement, each for the other, between consideration and promise.",0,0,0,0,0,0
A good example of the former branch of the proposition is to be found in a Massachusetts case.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The plaintiff refused to let certain wood be removed from his land by one who had made an oral bargain and given his note for it, unless he received additional security.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The purchaser and the plaintiff accordingly went to the defendant, and the defendant put his name upon the note.",1,1,1,1,1,1
The plaintiff thereupon let the purchaser carry off the wood.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, according to the testimony, the defendant signed without knowing that the plaintiff was to alter his position in any way on the faith of the signature, and it was held that, if that story was believed, there was no consideration.",1,1,1,1,1,1

"In such a case the reward cannot be claimed, because the alleged consideration has not been furnished on the faith of the offer.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The tendered promise has not induced the furnishing of the consideration.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The promise cannot be set up as a conventional motive when it was not known until after the alleged consideration was performed.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Suppose that the [295] truckman is willing to carry the cask, and the owner to let him carry it, without any bargain, and that each knows the other's state of mind; but that the truckman, seeing his own advantage in the matter, says to the owner, In consideration of your delivering me the cask, and letting me carry it, I promise to carry it, and that the owner thereupon delivers it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I suppose that the promise would be binding.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The promise is offered in terms as the inducement for the delivery, and the delivery is made in terms as the inducement for the promise.",1,0,0,0,0,0

I mean the doctrine that an executed consideration will not sustain a subsequent promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been said, to be sure, that such a consideration was sufficient if preceded by a request.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But the objections to the view are plain.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the request was of such a nature, and so put, as reasonably to imply that the other person was to have a reward, there was an express promise, although not put in words, and that promise was made at [296] the same time the consideration was given, and not afterwards.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If, on the other hand, the words did not warrant the understanding that the service was to be paid for, the service was a gift, and a past gift can no more be a consideration than any other act of the promisee not induced by the promise.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The source of the error can be traced partially, at least, in history.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Some suggestions touching the matter were made in the last Lecture.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A few words should be added here.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the old cases of debt, where there was some question whether the plaintiff had showed enough to maintain his action, a contract precedent was spoken of several times as raising the duty.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Thus, where a man had granted that he would be bound in one hundred shillings to pay his servant on a certain day for his services, and for payments made by the servant on his account, it was argued that there was no contract precedent, and that by parol the party is not obliged; and, further, that, so far as appeared, the payments were made by the servant out of his own head and at no request, from which no duty could commence.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"/1/ So when debt was brought on a deed to pay the plaintiff ten marks, if he would take the defendant's daughter to wife, and it was objected that the action should have been covenant, it was answered that the plaintiff had a contract precedent which gave him debt.",1,1,1,1,1,1
/2/ The first case in assumpsit /3/ only meant to adopt this long familiar thought.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A man went bail for his friend's servant, who had been arrested.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"Afterwards the master [297] promised to indemnify the bail, and on his failure to do so was sued by him in assumpsit.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It was held that there was no consideration wherefore the defendant should be charged unless the master had first promised to indemnify the plaintiff before the servant was bailed; for the master did never make request to the plaintiff for his servant to do so much, but he did it of his own head.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is perfectly plain sailing, and means no more than the case in the Year Books.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The report, however, also states a case in which it was held that a subsequent promise, in consideration that the plaintiff at the special instance of the defendant had married the defendant's cousin, was binding, and that the marriage was good cause... because [it] ensued the request of the defendant.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Whether this was intended to establish a general principle, or was decided with reference to the peculiar consideration of marriage, /1/ it was soon interpreted in the broader sense, as was shown in the last Lecture.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was several times adjudged that a past and executed matter was a sufficient consideration for a promise at a later day, if only the matter relied on had been done or furnished at the request of the promisor.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ It is now time to analyze the nature of a promise, which is the second and most conspicuous element in a simple contract.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Indian Contract Act, 1872, Section 2,8 says:--  (a.)",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When one person signifies to another his willingness [298] to do or to abstain from doing anything, with a view to obtaining the assent of that other to such act or abstinence, he is said to make a proposal:  (b.)",1,1,1,1,1,1
"When the person to whom the proposal is made signifies his assent thereto, the proposal is said to be accepted.",1,0,0,0,0,0
A proposal when accepted becomes a promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
According to this definition the scope of promises is confined to conduct on the part of the promisor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If this only meant that the promisor alone must bear the legal burden which his promise may create, it would be true.",1,1,1,1,1,1
But this is not the meaning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For the definition is of a promise, not of a legally binding promise.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are not seeking for the legal effects of a contract, but for the possible contents of a promise which the law may or may not enforce.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"An assurance that it shall rain to-morrow, /1/ or that a third person shall paint a picture, may as well be a promise as one that the promisee shall receive from some source one hundred bales of cotton, or that the promisor will pay the promisee one hundred dollars.",1,0,0,0,0,0
What is the difference in the cases?,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is only in the degree of power possessed by the promisor over the event.,0,0,0,0,0,0
He has none in the first case.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He has equally little legal authority to make a man paint a picture, although he may have larger means of persuasion.",1,1,0,1,1,0
He probably will be able to make sure that the promisee has the cotton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Being a rich man, he is certain [299] to be able to pay the one hundred dollars, except in the event of some most improbable accident.",1,1,1,1,0,0
"But the law does not inquire, as a general thing, how far the accomplishment of an assurance touching the future is within the power of the promisor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the moral world it may be that the obligation of a promise is confined to what lies within reach of the will of the promisor (except so far as the limit is unknown on one side, and misrepresented on the other).",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But unless some consideration of public policy intervenes, I take it that a man may bind himself at law that any future event shall happen.",1,1,1,1,0,0
He can therefore promise it in a legal sense.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be said that when a man covenants that it shall rain to-morrow, or that A shall paint a picture, he only says, in a short form, I will pay if it does not rain, or if A does not paint a picture.",1,1,1,1,1,1
But that is not necessarily so.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A promise could easily be framed which would be broken by the happening of fair weather, or by A not painting.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A promise, then, is simply an accepted assurance that a certain event or state of things shall come to pass.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But if this be true, it has more important bearings than simply to enlarge the definition of the word promise.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It concerns the theory of contract.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The consequences of a binding promise at common law are not affected by the degree of power which the promisor possesses over the promised event.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the promised event does not come to pass, the plaintiff's property is sold to satisfy the damages, within certain limits, which the promisee has suffered by the failure.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The consequences are the same in kind whether the promise is that it shall rain, or that another man shall paint a picture, or that the promisor will deliver a bale of cotton.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"[300] If the legal consequence is the same in all cases, it seems proper that all contracts should be considered from the same legal point of view.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the case of a binding promise that it shall rain to-morrow, the immediate legal effect of what the promisor does is, that he takes the risk of the event, within certain defined limits, as between himself and the promisee.",1,1,0,1,1,0
He does no more when he promises to deliver a bale of cotton.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"If it be proper to state the common-law meaning of promise and contract in this way, it has the advantage of freeing the subject from the superfluous theory that contract is a qualified subjection of one will to another, a kind of limited slavery.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It might be so regarded if the law compelled men to perform their contracts, or if it allowed promisees to exercise such compulsion.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If, when a man promised to labor for another, the law made him do it, his relation to his promisee might be called a servitude ad hoc with some truth.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But that is what the law never does.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It never interferes until a promise has been broken, and therefore cannot possibly be performed according to its tenor.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It is true that in some instances equity does what is called compelling specific performance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But, in the first place, I am speaking of the common law, and, in the next, this only means that equity compels the performance of certain elements of the total promise which are still capable of performance.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, take a promise to convey land within a certain time, a court of equity is not in the habit of interfering until the time has gone by, so that the promise cannot be performed as made.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But if the conveyance is more important than the time, and the promisee prefers to have it late rather than never, the law may compel the performance of [301] that.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Not literally compel even in that case, however, but put the promisor in prison unless he will convey.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This remedy is an exceptional one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The only universal consequence of a legally binding promise is, that the law makes the promisor pay damages if the promised event does not come to pass.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In every case it leaves him free from interference until the time for fulfilment has gone by, and therefore free to break his contract if he chooses.",1,1,0,1,1,0
A more practical advantage in looking at a contract as the taking of a risk is to be found in the light which it throws upon the measure of damages.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"If a breach of contract were regarded in the same light as a tort, it would seem that if, in the course of performance of the contract the promisor should be notified of any particular consequence which would result from its not being performed, he should be held liable for that consequence in the event of non-performance.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Such a suggestion has been made.,0,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ But it has not been accepted as the law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the contrary, according to the opinion of a very able judge, which seems to be generally followed, notice, even at the time of making the contract, of special circumstances out of which special damages would arise in case of breach, is not sufficient unless the assumption of that risk is to be taken as having fairly entered into the contract.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ If a carrier should undertake to carry the machinery of a saw-mill from Liverpool to Vancouver's Island, and should fail [302] to do so, he probably would not be held liable for the rate of hire of such machinery during the necessary delay, although he might know that it could not be replaced without sending to England, unless he was fairly understood to accept the contract with the special condition attached to it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ It is true that, when people make contracts, they usually contemplate the performance rather than the breach.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The express language used does not generally go further than to define what will happen if the contract is fulfilled.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A statutory requirement of a memorandum in writing would be satisfied by a written statement of the promise as made, because to require more would be to run counter to the ordinary habits of mankind, as well as because the statement that the effect of a contract is the assumption of the risk of a future event does not mean that there is a second subsidiary promise to assume that risk, but that the assumption follows as a consequence directly enforced by the law, without the promisor's co-operation.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"So parol evidence would be admissible, no doubt, to enlarge or diminish the extent of the liability assumed for nonperformance, where it would be inadmissible to affect the scope of the promise.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But these concessions do not affect the view here taken.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As the relation of contractor and contractee is voluntary, the consequences attaching to the relation must be voluntary.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What the event contemplated by the promise is, or in other words what will amount to a breach of contract, is a matter of interpretation and construction.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"What consequences of the breach are assumed is more remotely, in like manner, a matter of construction, having regard [303] to the circumstances under which the contract is made.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Knowledge of what is dependent upon performance is one of those circumstances.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is not necessarily conclusive, but it may have the effect of enlarging the risk assumed.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The very office of construction is to work out, from what is expressly said and done, what would have been said with regard to events not definitely before the minds of the parties, if those events had been considered.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The price paid in mercantile contracts generally excludes the construction that exceptional risks were intended to be assumed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The foregoing analysis is believed to show that the result which has been reached by the courts on grounds of practical good sense, falls in with the true theory of contract under the common law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The discussion of the nature of a promise has led me to analyze contract and the consequences of contract somewhat in advance of their place.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I must say a word more concerning the facts which constitute a promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is laid down, with theoretical truth, that, besides the assurance or offer on the one side, there must be an acceptance on the other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I find it hard to think of a case where a simple contract fails to be made, which could not be accounted for on other grounds, generally by the want of relation between assurance or offer and consideration as reciprocal inducements each of the other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Acceptance of an offer usually follows by mere implication from the furnishing of the consideration; and inasmuch as by our law an accepted offer, or promise, until the consideration is furnished, stands on no different footing from an offer not yet accepted, each being subject to revocation until that time, and each continuing [304] until then unless it has expired or has been revoked, the question of acceptance is rarely of practical importance.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Assuming that the general nature of consideration and promise is understood, some questions peculiar to bilateral contracts remain to be considered.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These concern the sufficiency of the consideration and the moment when the contract is made.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A promise may be a consideration for a promise, although not every promise for every other.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It may be doubted whether a promise to make a gift of one hundred dollars would be supported by a promise to accept it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"But in a case of mutual promises respectively to transfer and to accept unpaid shares in a railway company, it has been held that a binding contract was made.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Here one party agrees to part with something which may prove valuable, and the other to assume a liability which may prove onerous.",0,0,0,0,0,0

/2/ But this does not seem to me sound.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Contracts are dealings between men, by which they make arrangements for the future.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In making such arrangements the important thing is, not what is objectively true, but what the parties know.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Any present fact which is unknown to the parties is just as uncertain for the purposes of making an arrangement at this moment, as any future fact.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is therefore a detriment to undertake to be ready to pay if the event turns out not [305] to have been as expected.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This seems to be the true explanation why forbearance to sue upon a claim believed the plaintiff to be good is a sufficient consideration, although the claim was bad in fact, and known by the defendant to be bad.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Were this view unsound, it is hard to see how wagers on any future event, except a miracle, could be sustained.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"So far as merely logical grounds go, the most ingenious argument in favor of the later moment is Professor Langdell's.",0,0,0,0,0,0
According to him the conclusion follows from the fact that the consideration which makes the offer binding is itself a promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every promise, he says, is an offer before it is a promise, and the essence of an offer is that it should be communicated.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ But this reasoning seems unsound.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When, as in the case supposed, the consideration for the return promise has been put into the power of the offeree and the return promise has been accepted in advance, there is not an instant, either in time or logic, when the return promise is an offer.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It is a promise and a term of a binding contract as soon as it is anything.,1,0,0,0,0,0
An offer is a revocable and unaccepted communication of willingness to promise.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[306] When an offer of a certain bilateral contract has been made, the same contract cannot be offered by the other side.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The so-called offer would neither be revocable nor unaccepted.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It would complete the contract as soon as made.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it be said that it is of the essence of a promise to be communicated, whether it goes through the stage of offer or not, meaning by communicated brought to the actual knowledge of the promisee, the law is believed to be otherwise.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"A covenant is binding when it is delivered and accepted, whether it is read or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"On the same principle, it is believed that, whenever the obligation is to be entered into by a tangible sign, as, in the case supposed, by letter containing the return promise, and the consideration for and assent to the promise are already given, the only question is when the tangible sign is sufficiently put into the power of the promisee.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"/1/ If I am right, it appears of little importance whether the post-office be regarded as agent or bailee for the offerer, or as a mere box to which he has access.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The offeree, when he drops the letter containing the counter-promise into the letter-box, does an overt act, which by general understanding renounces control over the letter, and puts it into a third hand for the benefit of the offerer, with liberty to the latter at any moment thereafter to take it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The principles governing revocation are wholly different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
One to whom an offer is made has a right to assume that it remains open according to its terms until he has actual [307] notice to the contrary.,1,1,1,1,1,1

VOID AND VOIDABLE.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"THE elements of fact necessary to call a contract into existence, and the legal consequences of a contract when formed, have been discussed.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It remains to consider successively the cases in which a contract is said to be void, and those in which it is said to be voidable,--in which, that is, a contract fails to be made when it seems to have been, or, having been made, can be rescinded by one side or the other, and treated as if it had never been.",1,0,0,0,0,0
I take up the former class of cases first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When a contract fails to be made, although the usual forms have been gone through with, the ground of failure is commonly said to be mistake, misrepresentation, or fraud.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But I shall try to show that these are merely dramatic circumstances, and that the true ground is the absence of one or more of the primary elements, which have been shown, or are seen at once, to be necessary to the existence of a contract.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a man goes through the form of making a contract with A through B as A's agent, and B is not in fact the agent of A, there is no contract, because there is only one party.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The promise offered to A has not been accepted by him, and no consideration has moved from him.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"In such a case, although there is generally mistake on one side and fraud on the other, it is very clear that no special [309] doctrine need be resorted to, because the primary elements of a contract explained in the last Lecture are not yet present.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Take next a different case.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The defendant agreed to buy, and the plaintiff agreed to sell, a cargo of cotton, to arrive ex Peerless from Bombay.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"There were two such vessels sailing from Bombay, one in October, the other in December.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The plaintiff meant the latter, the defendant the former.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It was held that the defendant was not bound to accept the cotton.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ It is commonly said that such a contract is void, because of mutual mistake as to the subject-matter, and because therefore the parties did not consent to the same thing.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But this way of putting it seems to me misleading.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The law has nothing to do with the actual state of the parties' minds.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In contract, as elsewhere, it must go by externals, and judge parties by their conduct.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If there had been but one Peerless, and the defendant had said Peerless by mistake, meaning Peri, he would have been bound.",1,1,1,0,1,0
"The true ground of the decision was not that each party meant a different thing from the other, as is implied by the explanation which has been mentioned, but that each said a different thing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The plaintiff offered one thing, the defendant expressed his assent to another.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"A proper name, when used in business or in pleading, /2/ means one individual thing, and no other, as every one knows, and therefore one to whom such a name is used must find out at his peril what the object designated is.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If there are no circumstances which make the use deceptive on either side, each is entitled to insist on the [310] meaning favorable to him for the word as used by him, and neither is entitled to insist on that meaning for the word as used by the other.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"So far from mistake having been the ground of decision, as mistake, its only bearing, as it seems to me, was to establish that neither party knew that he was understood by the other to use the word Peerless in the sense which the latter gave to it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In that event there would perhaps have been a binding contract, because, if a man uses a word to which he knows the other party attaches, and understands him to attach, a certain meaning, he may be held to that meaning, and not be allowed to give it any other.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Next, suppose a case in which the offer and acceptance do not differ, and in which both parties have used the same words in the same sense.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Suppose that A agreed to buy, and B agreed to sell, these barrels of mackerel, and that the barrels in question turn out to contain salt.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There is mutual mistake as to the contents of the barrels, and no fraud on either side.",0,0,0,0,0,0
I suppose the contract would be void.,0,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ It is commonly said that the failure of the contract in such a case is due to the fact of a difference in kind between the actual subject-matter and that to which the intention of the parties was directed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is perhaps more instructive to say that the terms of the supposed contract, although seemingly consistent, were contradictory, in matters that went to the root of the bargain.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For, by one of the essential terms, the subject-matter of the agreement was the contents of certain barrels, and nothing else, and, by another equally important, it was mackerel, and nothing else; [311] while, as a matter of fact, it could not be both, because the contents of the barrels were salt.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As neither term could be left out without forcing on the parties a contract which they did not make, it follows that A cannot be required to accept, nor B to deliver either these barrels of salt, or other barrels of mackerel; and without omitting one term, the promise is meaningless.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If there had been fraud on the seller's part, or if he had known what the barrels really contained, the buyer might have had a right to insist on delivery of the inferior article.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Fraud would perhaps have made the contract valid at his option.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Because, when a man qualifies sensible words with others which he knows, on secret grounds, are insensible when so applied, he may fairly be taken to authorize his promisee to insist on the possible part of his promise being performed, if the promisee is willing to forego the rest.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Take one more illustration like the last case.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A policy of insurance is issued on a certain building described in the policy as a machine-shop.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In fact the building is not a machine-shop, but an organ factory, which is a greater risk.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The contract is void, not because of any misrepresentation, but, as before, because two of its essential terms are repugnant, and their union is insensible.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ Of course the principle of repugnancy last explained might be stretched to apply to any inconsistency between the different terms of a contract.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It might be said, for instance, that if a piece of gold is sold as eighteen-carat gold, and it is in fact not so pure, or if a cow is sold as yielding an average of twelve quarts of milk a day, and in fact she yields only six quarts, there is no logical difference, [312] according to the explanation which has just been offered, between those cases and that of the barrel of salt sold for mackerel.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Yet those bargains would not be void.,0,0,0,0,0,0

It therefore does not make the dealings of men dependent on a mathematical accuracy.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"/1/ For it is further to be said that, so far as by one of the terms of a contract the thing promised or the promisee is identified by sight and hearing, that term so far preponderates over all others that it is very rare for the failure of any other element of description to prevent the making of a contract.",0,0,0,0,0,0

A different case may be suggested from any yet considered.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"For instance, it might be said that the true and well-understood purport of a contract of insurance is not, as the words seem to say, to take the risk of any loss by fire or perils of the sea, however great the risk may be, but to take a risk of a certain magnitude, and no other, which risk has been calculated mathematically from the statements of the party insured.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"I think that it may now be assumed that, when fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake is said to make a contract void, there is no new principle which comes in to set aside an otherwise perfect obligation, but that in every such case there is wanting one or more of the first elements which were explained in the foregoing Lecture.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Such is always the case if the condition of a promise lies within the control of the promisor's own will.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The conditions which a contract may contain have been divided by theorists into conditions precedent and conditions subsequent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The distinction has even been pronounced of great importance.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It must be admitted that, if the course of pleading be taken as a test, it is so.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In some cases, the plaintiff has to state that a condition has been performed in order to put the defendant to his answer; in others, it is left to the defendant to set up that a condition has been broken.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"In one sense, all conditions are subsequent; in another, all are precedent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
All are subsequent to the first stage of the obligation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/4/ Take, for instance, the case of a promise to pay for work if done to the satisfaction of an architect.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The condition is a clear case of what is called a condition precedent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There can be no duty to pay until the architect is satisfied.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But there can be a [317] contract before that moment, because the determination whether the promisor shall pay or not is no longer within his control.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Hence the condition is subsequent to the existence of the obligation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the other hand, every condition subsequent is precedent to the incidence of the burden of the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If we look at the law as it would be regarded by one who had no scruples against doing anything which he could do without incurring legal consequences, it is obvious that the main consequence attached by the law to a contract is a greater or less possibility of having to pay money.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The only question from the purely legal point of view is whether the promisor will be compelled to pay.,0,0,0,0,0,0
And the important moment is that at which that point is settled.,0,0,0,0,0,0
All conditions are precedent to that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But all conditions are precedent, not only in this extreme sense, but also to the existence of the plaintiff's cause of action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
As strong a case as can be put is that of a policy of insurance conditioned to be void if not sued upon within one year from a failure to pay as agreed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The condition does not come into play until a loss has occurred, the duty to pay has been neglected, and a cause of action has arisen.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nevertheless, it is precedent to the plaintiff's cause of action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When a man sues, the question is not whether he has had a cause of action in the past, but whether he has one then.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"He has not one then, unless the year is still running.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If it were left for the defendant to set up the lapse of the year, that would be due to the circumstance that the order of pleading does not require a plaintiff to meet all possible defences, and to set out a case unanswerable except by denial.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The point at which the law calls on the defendant for an answer varies [318] in different cases.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Sometimes it would seem to be governed simply by convenience of proof, requiring the party who has the affirmative to plead and prove it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Sometimes there seems to be a reference to the usual course of events, and matters belong to the defence because they are only exceptionally true.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The most logical distinction would be between conditions which must be satisfied before a promise can be broken, and those which, like the last, discharge the liability after a breach has occurred.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ But this is of the slightest possible importance, and it may be doubted whether another case like the last could be found.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is much more important to mark the distinction between a stipulation which only has the effect of confining a promise to certain cases, and a condition properly so called.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Every condition, it is true, has this effect upon the promise to which it is attached, so that, whatever the rule of pleading may be, /2/ a promise is as truly kept and performed by doing nothing where the condition of the stipulated act has been broken, as it would have been by doing the act if the condition had been fulfilled.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But if this were all, every clause in a contract which showed what the promisor did not promise would be a condition, and the word would be worse than useless.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The characteristic feature is quite different.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A condition properly so called is an event, the happening of which authorizes the person in whose favor the condition is reserved to treat the contract as if it had not been made,--to avoid it, as is commonly said,--that is, to insist on both parties being restored to the position in [319] which they stood before the contract was made.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"When a condition operates as such, it lets in an outside force to destroy the existing state of things.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For although its existence is due to consent of parties, its operation depends on the choice of one of them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"When a condition is broken, the person entitled to insist on it may do so if he chooses; but he may, if he prefers, elect to keep the contract on foot.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"He gets his right to avoid it from the agreement, but the avoidance comes from him.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"Hence it is important to distinguish those stipulations which have this extreme effect from those which only interpret the extent of a promise, or define the events to which it applies.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And as it has just been shown that a condition need not be insisted on as such, we must further distinguish between its operation by way of avoidance, which is peculiar to it, and its incidental working by way of interpretation and definition, in common with other clauses not conditions.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is best illustrated by taking a bilateral contract between A and B, where A's undertaking is conditional on B's doing what he promises to do, and where, after A has got a certain distance in his task, B breaks his half of the bargain.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"For instance, A is employed as a clerk by B, and is wrongfully dismissed in the middle of a quarter.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In favor of A, the contract is conditional on B's keeping his agreement to employ him.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Whether A insists on the condition or not, he is not bound to do any more.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"/1/ So far, the condition works simply by way of definition.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It establishes that A has not promised to act in the case which has happened.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But besides this, for which a condition [320] was not necessary, A may take his choice between two courses.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"In the first place, he may elect to avoid the contract.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In that case the parties stand as if no contract had been made, and A, having done work for B which was understood not to be gratuitous, and for which no rate of compensation has been fixed, can recover what the jury think his services were reasonably worth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The contract no longer determines the quid pro quo.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But as an alternative course A may stand by the contract if he prefers to do so, and sue B for breaking it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In that case he can recover as part of his damages pay at the contract rate for what he had done, as well as compensation for his loss of opportunity to finish it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the points which are material for the present discussion are, that these two remedies are mutually exclusive, /1/ one supposing the contract to be relied on, the other that it is set aside, but that A's stopping work and doing no more after B's breach is equally consistent with either choice, and has in fact nothing to do with the matter.",1,0,0,0,0,0
One word should be added to avoid misapprehension.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When it is said that A has done all that he promised to do in the case which has happened, it is not meant that he is necessarily entitled to the same compensation as if he had done the larger amount of work.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"B's promise in the case supposed was to pay so much a quarter for services; and although the consideration of the promise was the promise by A to perform them, the scope of it was limited to the case of their being performed in fact.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence A could not simply wait till the end of his term, and then recover the full amount which he would have had if the employment had continued.",1,1,1,1,1,1
Nor is he any more entitled to do so from [321] the fact that it was B's fault that the services were not rendered.,1,1,1,1,1,1
B's answer to any such claim is perfect.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"He is only liable upon a promise, and he in his turn only promised to pay in a case which has not happened.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"He did promise to employ, however, and for not doing that he is liable in damages.",1,1,0,1,1,0
One or two more illustrations will be useful.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A promises to deliver, and B promises to accept and pay for, certain goods at a certain time and place.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"When the time comes, neither party is on hand.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Neither would be liable to an action, and, according to what has been said, each has done all that he promised to do in the event which has happened, to wit, nothing.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"It might be objected that, if A has done all that he is bound to do, he ought to be able to sue B, since performance or readiness to perform was all that was necessary to give him that right, and conversely the same might be said of B.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"On the other hand, considering either B or A as defendant, the same facts would be a complete defence.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The puzzle is largely one of words.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A and B have, it is true, each performed all that they promised to do at the present stage, because they each only promised to act in the event of the other being ready and willing to act at the same time.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the readiness and willingness, although not necessary to the performance of either promise, and therefore not a duty, was necessary in order to present a case to which the promise of action on the other side would apply.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Hence, although A and B have each performed their own promise, they have not performed the condition to their right of demanding more from the other side.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The performance of that condition is purely optional until one side has brought it within the [322] scope of the other's undertaking by performing it himself.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"But it is performance in the latter sense, that is, the satisfying of all conditions, as well as the keeping of his own promises, which is necessary to give A or B a right of action.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Conditions may be created by the very words of a contract.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of such cases there is nothing to be said, for parties may agree to what they choose.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But they may also be held to arise by construction, where no provision is made in terms for rescinding or avoiding the contract in any case.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The nature of the conditions which the law thus reads in needs explanation.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It may be said, in a general way, that they are directed to the existence of the manifest grounds for making the bargain on the side of the rescinding party, or the accomplishment of its manifest objects.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But that is not enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Generally speaking, the disappointment must be caused by the wrong-doing of the person on the other side; and the most obvious cases of such wrong-doing are fraud and misrepresentation, or failure to perform his own part of the contract.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Fraud and misrepresentation thus need to be considered once more in this connection.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I take the latter first.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In dealing with it the first question which arises is whether the representation is, or is not, part of the contract.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the contract is in writing and the representation is set out on the face of the paper, it may be material or immaterial, but the effect of its untruth will be determined on much the same principles as govern the failure to perform a promise on the same side.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If the contract is made by word of mouth, there may be a large latitude in connecting words of representation with later words of promise; but when they are determined to be a part of the contract [323], the same principles apply as if the whole were in writing.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The question now before us is the effect of a misrepresentation which leads to, but is not a part of, the contract.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Suppose that the contract is in writing, but does not contain it, does such a previous misrepresentation authorize rescission in any case?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"and if so, does it in any case except where it goes to the height of fraud?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The promisor might say, It does not matter to me whether you knew that your representation was false or not; the only thing I am concerned with is its truth.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If it is untrue, I suffer equally whether you knew it to be so or not.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But it has been shown, in an earlier Lecture, that the law does not go on the principle that a man is answerable for all the consequences of all his acts.",1,1,1,1,0,0
An act is indifferent in itself.,1,0,0,0,0,0
It receives its character from the concomitant facts known to the actor at the time.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"If a man states a thing reasonably believing that he is speaking from knowledge, it is contrary to the analogies of the law to throw the peril of the truth upon him unless he agrees to assume that peril, and he did not do so in the case supposed, as the representation was not made part of the contract.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It is very different when there is fraud.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Fraud may as well lead to the making of a contract by a statement outside the contract as by one contained in it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
But the law would hold the contract not less conditional on good faith in one case than in the other.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To illustrate, we may take a somewhat extreme case.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A says to B, I have not opened these barrels myself, but they contain No.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"1 mackerel: I paid so much for them to so and so, naming a well-known dealer.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"If outside the contract, they cannot often affect its interpretation.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"A promise in certain words has a definite meaning, which the promisor is presumed to understand.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If A says to B, I promise you to buy this barrel and its contents, his words designate a person and thing identified by the senses, and they signify nothing more.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"There is no repugnancy, and if that person is ready to deliver that thing, the purchaser cannot say that any term in the contract itself is not complied with.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"He may have been fraudulently induced to believe that B was another B, and that the barrel contained mackerel; but however much his belief on those points may have affected his willingness to make the promise, it would be somewhat extravagant to give his words a different meaning on that account.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"You means the person before the speaker, whatever his name, and contents applies to salt, as well as to mackerel.",1,1,1,1,1,1
It is no doubt only by reason of a condition construed into the contract that fraud is a ground of rescission.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Parties could agree, if they chose, that a contract should be binding without regard to truth or falsehood outside of it on either part.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But, as has been said before in these Lectures, although the law starts from the distinctions and uses the language of morality, it necessarily ends in external standards not dependent on the actual consciousness of the individual.",1,0,0,0,0,0
[325] So it has happened with fraud.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a man makes a representation, knowing facts which by the average standard of the community are sufficient to give him warning that it is probably untrue, and it is untrue, he is guilty of fraud in theory of law whether he believes his statement or not.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The courts of Massachusetts, at least, go much further.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"They seem to hold that any material statement made by a man as of his own knowledge, or in such a way as fairly to be understood as made of his own knowledge, is fraudulent if untrue, irrespective of the reasons he may have had for believing it and for believing that he knew it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ It is clear, therefore, that a representation may be morally innocent, and yet fraudulent in theory of law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Indeed, the Massachusetts rule seems to stop little short of the principle laid down by the English courts of equity, which has been criticised in an earlier Lecture, /2/ since most positive affirmations of facts would at least warrant a jury in finding that they were reasonably understood to be made as of the party's own knowledge, and might therefore warrant a rescission if they turned out to be untrue.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The moral phraseology has ceased to be apposite, and an external standard of responsibility has been reached.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But the starting-point is nevertheless fraud, and except on the ground of fraud, as defined by law, I do not think that misrepresentations before the contract affect its validity, although they lead directly to its making.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But neither the contract nor the implied condition calls for the existence of the facts as to which the false representations were made.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They call only for the absence of certain false representations.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The condition is not that the promisee shall be a certain other B, or that the contents of the barrel shall be mackerel, [326] but that the promisee has not lied to him about material facts.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"Then the question arises, How do you determine what facts are material?",0,0,0,0,0,0
"As the facts are not required by the contract, the only way in which they can be material is that a belief in their being true is likely to have led to the making of the contract.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is not then true, as it is sometimes said, that the law does not concern itself with the motives for making contracts.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"On the contrary, the whole scope of fraud outside the contract is the creation of false motives and the removal of true ones.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And this consideration will afford a reasonable test of the cases in which fraud will warrant rescission.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is said that a fraudulent representation must be material to have that effect.,1,0,0,0,0,0
But how are we to decide whether it is material or not?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the above argument is correct, it must be by an appeal to ordinary experience to decide whether a belief that the fact was as represented would naturally have led to, or a contrary belief would naturally have prevented, the making of the contract.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the belief would not naturally have had such an effect, either in general or under the known circumstances of the particular case, the fraud is immaterial.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If a man is induced to contract with another by a fraudulent representation of the latter that he is a great-grandson of Thomas Jefferson, I do not suppose that the contract would be voidable unless the contractee knew that, for special reasons, his lie would tend to bring the contract about.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The conditions or grounds for avoiding a contract which have been dealt with thus far are conditions concerning the conduct of the parties outside of the itself.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Joinder of possessions, he says, that is, the right to add the time of one's predecessor's holding to one's own, clearly belongs to those who succeed to the place of others, whether by contract or by will: for heirs and those who are treated as holding the place of successors are allowed to add their testator's possession to their own.",1,0,0,0,0,0

It is said that even when the heir was bound he could not be sued except in case the executor had no assets.,1,1,1,1,1,1
/1/ But there was another ancient obligation which had a different history.,0,0,0,0,0,0
I refer to the warranty which arose upon the transfer of property.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We should call it a contract, but it probably presented itself to the mind of Glanvill's predecessors simply as a duty or obligation attached by law to a transaction which was directed to a different point; just as the liability of a bailee, which is now treated as arising from his undertaking, was originally raised by the law out of the position in which he stood toward third persons.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"After the Conquest we do not hear much of warranty, except in connection with land, and this fact will at once [372] account for its having had a different history from debt.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The obligation of warranty was to defend the title, and, if the defence failed, to give to the evicted owner other land of equal value.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"If a man was sued for property which he had bought from another, the regular course of litigation was for the defendant to summon in his seller to take charge of the defence, and for him, in turn, to summon in his, if he had one, and so on until a party was reached in the chain of title who finally took the burden of the case upon himself.",1,1,1,1,0,0

"Bracton, who modelled his book upon the writings of the mediaeval civilians, shows how this thought was used.",0,0,0,0,0,0
He first puts the case of a conveyance with the usual clause binding the grantor and his heirs to warrant and defend the grantee and his heirs.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"He then goes on: Again one may make his gift greater and make other persons quasi heirs [of his grantee], although, in fact, they are not heirs, as when he says in the gift, to have and to hold to such a one and his heirs, or to whomsoever he shall choose to give or assign the said land, and I and my heirs will warrant to the said so and so, and his heirs, or to whomsoever he shall choose to give or assign the said land, and their heirs, against all persons.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In which case if the grantee shall have given or assigned the land, and then have died without heirs, the [first] grantor and his heirs begin to hold the place of the first grantee and his heirs, and are in place of the first grantee's heir (pro herede) so far as concerns warranting to his assigns and their heirs [374] according to the clause contained in the first grantor's charter, which would not be but for the mention of assigns in the first gift.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But so long as the first grantee survives, or his heirs, they are held to warranty, and not the first grantor.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Here we see that, in order to entitle the assign to the benefit of the first grantor's warranty, assigns must be mentioned in the original grant and covenant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The scope of the ancient obligation was not extended without the warrantor's assent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"But when it was extended, it was not by a contrivance like a modern letter of credit.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Such a conception would have been impossible in that stage of the law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
By mentioning assigns the first grantor did not offer a covenant to any person who would thereafter purchase the land.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If that had been the notion, there would have been a contract directly binding the first grantor to the assign, as soon as the land was sold, and thus there would have been two warranties arising from the same clause,--one to the first grantee, a second to the assign.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But in fact the assign recovered on the original warranty to the first grantee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ He could only come on the first grantor after a failure of his immediate grantor's heirs.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"Practically it made little difference whether the assign got the benefit of the first grantor's warranty mediately or immediately, if he got it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The trouble arose where he could not summon the mesne grantor, and the new right was given him for that case alone.",1,1,0,1,1,0

"/1/ If it should be suggested that what has been said goes to show that the first grantor's duty to warrant arose from the assign's becoming his man and owing homage, the answer is that he was not bound unless he had mentioned assigns in his grant, homage or no homage.",1,1,1,1,1,1
In this Bracton is confirmed by all the later authorities.,0,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ Another rule on which there are vast stores of forgotten learning will show how exactly the fiction fell in with the earlier law.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Only those who were privy in estate with the person to whom the warranty was originally given, could vouch the original warrantor.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Looking back to the early [376] procedure, it will be seen that of course only those in the same chain of title could even mediately get the benefit of a former owner's warranty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The ground on which a man was bound to warrant was that he had conveyed the property to the person who summoned him.,1,1,1,1,0,0
"Hence a man could summon no one but his grantor, and the successive vouchers came to an end when the last vouchee could not call on another from whom he had bought.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Now when the process was abridged, no persons were made liable to summons who would not have been liable before.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The present owner was allowed to vouch directly those who otherwise would have been indirectly bound to defend his title, but no others.",1,1,1,1,1,1
Hence he could only summon those from whom his grantor derived his title.,1,1,0,1,1,0
But this was equally well expressed in terms of the fiction employed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In order to vouch, the present owner must have the estate of the person to whom the warranty was made.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As every lawyer knows, the estate does not mean the land.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"To return to Bracton, it must be understood that the description of assigns as quasi heredes is not accidental.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"He even pushes the reasoning drawn from the analogy of inheritance to extremes, and refers to it in countless passages.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance: It should be noted that of heirs some are true heirs and some quasi [377] heirs, in place of heirs, &c.; true heirs by way of succession quasi heirs, &c. by the form of the gift; such as assigns, &c. /1/ If it should be suggested that Bracton's language is only a piece of mediaeval scholasticism, there are several answers.",0,0,0,0,0,0
In the first place it is nearly contemporaneous with the first appearance of the right in question.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This is shown by his citing authority for it as for something which might be disputed.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"He says, And that warranty must be made to assigns according to the form of the gift is proved [by a case] in the circuit of W. de Ralegh, about the end of the roll,&c. /2/ It is not justifiable to assume that a contemporary explanation of a new rule had nothing to do with its appearance.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Again, the fact is clear that the assign got the benefit of the warranty to the first grantee, not of a new one to himself, as has been shown, and Bracton's explanation of how this was worked out falls in with what has been seen of the course of the German and Anglo-Saxon law, and with the pervading thought of the Roman law.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Finally, and most important, the requirement that the assign should be in of the first grantee's estate has remained a requirement from that day to this.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The fact that the same thing is required in the same words as in prescription goes far to show that the same technical thought has governed both.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"I have said, Glanvill's predecessors probably regarded warranty as an obligation incident to a conveyance, rather than as a contract.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But when it became usual to insert the undertaking to warrant in a deed or charter of feoffment, it lost something of its former isolation as a duty standing by itself, and admitted of being [378] generalized.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It was a promise by deed, and a promise by deed was a covenant.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"It differed also in the scope of its obligation from some other covenants, as will be shown hereafter.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But still it was a covenant, and could sometimes be sued on as such.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It was spoken of in the Year Books of Edward III.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"as a covenant which falls in the blood, /2/ as distinguished from those where the acquittance fell on the land, and not on the person.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/3/ The importance of this circumstance lies in the working of the law of warranty upon other covenants which took its place.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"When the old actions for land gave way to more modern and speedier forms, warrantors were no longer vouched in to defend, and if a grantee was evicted, damages took the place of a grant of other land.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The ancient warranty disappeared, and was replaced by the covenants which we still find in our deeds, including the covenants for seisin, for right to convey, against incumbrances, for quiet enjoyment, of warranty, and for further assurance.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the principles on which an assign could have the benefit of these covenants were derived from those which governed warranty, as any one may see by looking at the earlier decisions.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, the question, what was a sufficient assignment to give an assign the benefit of a covenant for quiet enjoyment, was argued and decided on the authority of the old cases of warranty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/4/ [379] The assign, as in warranty, came in under the old covenant with the first covenantee, not by any new right of his own.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Thus, in an action by an assign on a covenant for further assurance, the defendant set up a release by the original covenantee after the commencement of the suit.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The court held that the assignee should have the benefit of the covenant.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"They held, that although the breach was in the time of the assignee, yet if the release had been by the covenantee (who is a party to the deed, and from whom the plaintiff derives) before any breach, or before the suit commenced, it had been a good bar to the assignee from bringing this writ of covenant.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the breach of the covenant being in the time of the assignee,... and the action brought by him, and so attached in his person, the covenantee cannot release this action wherein the assignee is interested.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ The covenantee even after assignment remains the legal party to the contract.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The assign comes in under him, and does not put an end to his control over it, until by breach and action a new right attaches in the assign's person, distinct from the rights derived from the persona of his grantor.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Later, the assign got a more independent standing, as the original foundation of his rights sunk gradually out of sight, and a release after assignment became ineffectual, at least in the case of a covenant to pay rent.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ Only privies in estate with the original covenantee can have the benefit of covenants for title.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been shown that a similar limitation of the benefits of the ancient [380] warranty was required by its earlier history before the assign was allowed to sue, and that the fiction by which he got that right could not extend it beyond that limit.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This analogy also was followed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"For instance, a tenant in tail male made a lease for years with covenants of right to let and for quiet enjoyment, and then died without issue male.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The lessee assigned the lease to the plaintiff.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The latter was soon turned out, and thereupon brought an action upon the covenant against the executor of the lessor.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It was held that he could not recover, because he was not privy in estate with the original covenantee.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"For the lease, which was the original covenantee's estate, was ended by the death of the lessor and termination of the estate tail out of which the lease was granted, before the form of assignment to the plaintiff.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ The only point remaining to make the analogy between covenants for title and warranty complete was to require assigns to be mentioned in order to enable them to sue.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"In modern times, of course, such a requirement, if it should exist, would be purely formal, and would be of no importance except as an ear-mark by which to trace the history of a doctrine.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It would aid our studies if we could say that wherever assigns are to get the benefit of a covenant as privies in estate with the covenantee, they must be mentioned in the covenant.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Whether such a requirement does exist or not would be hard to tell from the decisions alone.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"In the reign of Henry IV., another case /2/ arose upon a covenant very like the last.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But this time the facts were reversed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The plaintiff counted as heir, but did not allege that he was tenant of the manor.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The defendant, not denying the plaintiff's descent, pleaded in substance that he was not tenant of the manor in his own right.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"The question raised by the pleadings, therefore, was whether the heir of the covenantee could sue without being tenant of the manor.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If the covenant was to be approached from the side of contract, the heir was party to it as representing the covenantee.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If, on the other hand, it was treated as amounting to the grant of a service like an easement, it would naturally go with the manor if made to the lord of the manor.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It seems to have been thought that such a covenant might go either way, according as it was made to the tenant of the manor or to a stranger.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Markham, one of the judges, says: In a writ of covenant one must be privy to the covenant if he would have a writ of covenant or aid by the covenant.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But, peradventure, if the covenant [399] had been made with the lord of the manor, who had inheritance in the manor, ou issint come determination poit estre fait, it would be otherwise, which was admitted.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ It was assumed that the covenant was not so made as to attach to the manor, and the court, observing that the service was rather spiritual than temporal, were inclined to think that the heir could sue.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ The defendant accordingly over and set up a release.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It will be seen how fully this agrees with the former case.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The distinction taken by Markham is stated very clearly in a reported by Lord Coke.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the argument of Chudleigh's Case the line is drawn thus: Always, the warranty as to voucher requires privity of estate to which it was annexed, (i.e.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"succession to the original covenantee,) and the same law of a use....",0,0,0,0,0,0
"But of things annexed to land, it is otherwise, as of commons, advowsons, and the like appendants or appurtenances....",1,0,0,0,0,0
"So a disseisor, abator, intruder, or the lord by escheat, &c., shall have them as things annexed to the land.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"So note a diversity between a use or warranty, and the like things annexed to the estate of the land in privity, and commons, advowsons, and other hereditaments annexed to the possession of the land.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ And this, it seems to me, is the nearest approach which has ever been made to the truth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Coke, in his Commentary on Littleton (385 a), takes a distinction between a warranty, which binds the party to yield lands in recompense, and a covenant annexed to the land, which is to yield but damages.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"If Lord Coke had [400] meant to distinguish between warranties and all covenants which in our loose modern sense are said to run with the land, this statement would be less satisfactory than the preceding.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"A warranty was a covenant which sometimes yielded but damages, and a covenant in the old law sometimes yielded land.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In looking at the early cases we are reminded of the still earlier German procedure, in which it did not matter whether the plaintiff's claim was founded on a right of property in a thing, or simply on a contract for it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Covenant was brought for a freehold under Edward I., /2/ and under Edward III.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"it seems that a mill could be abated by the same action, when maintained contrary to an easement created by covenant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ But Lord Coke did not mean to lay down any sweeping doctrine, for his conclusion is, that a covenant is in many cases extended further than the warrantie.",1,1,1,0,1,0
"Furthermore, this statement, as Lord Coke meant it, is perfectly consistent with the other and more important distinction between warranties and rights in the nature of easements or covenants creating such rights.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For Lord Coke's examples are confined to covenants of the latter sort, being in fact only the cases just stated from the Year Books.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Later writers, however, have wholly forgotten the distinction in question, and accordingly it has failed to settle the disputed line between conflicting principles.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Covenants which started from the analogy of warranties, and others to which was applied the language and reasoning of easements, have been confounded together under the title of [401] covenants running with the land.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The phrase running with the land is only appropriate to covenants which pass like easements.,0,0,0,0,0,0
But we can easily see how it came to be used more loosely.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has already been shown that covenants for title, like warranties, went only to successors of the original covenantee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The technical expression for the rule was that they were annexed to the estate in privity.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Nothing was easier than to overlook the technical use of the word estate, and to say that such covenants went with the land.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This was done, and forthwith all distinctions became doubtful.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It probably had been necessary to mention assigns in covenants for title, as it certainly had been to give them the benefit of the ancient warranty; /1/ for this seems to have been the formal mark of those covenants which passed only to privies.",1,0,0,0,0,0
But it was not necessary to mention assigns in order to attach easements and the like to land.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Why should it be necessary for one covenant running with the land more than another?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"and if necessary for one, why not for all?",0,0,0,0,0,0
/2/ The necessity of such mention in modern times has been supposed to be governed by a fanciful rule of Lord Coke's.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ On the other hand, the question is raised whether covenants which should pass irrespective of privity are not governed by the same rule which governs warranties.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These questions have not lost their importance.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Covenants for title are in every deed, and other covenants are [402] only less common, which, it remains to show, belong to the other class.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Chief among these is the covenant to repair.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has already been observed that an easement of fencing may be annexed to land, and it was then asked what was the difference in kind between a right to have another person build such structures, and a right to have him repair structures already built.",1,1,1,1,1,1
Evidence is not wanting to show that the likeness was perceived.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Only, as such covenants are rarely, if ever, made, except in leases, there is always privity to the original parties.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"For the lease could not, and the reversion would not be likely to, go by disseisin.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Dean of Windsor's Case decides that such a covenant binds an assignee of the term, although not named.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is reported in two books of the highest authority, one of the reporters being Lord Coke, the other Croke, who was also a judge.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Croke gives the reason thus: For a covenant which runs and rests with the land lies for or against the assignee at the common law, quia transit terra cum onere, although the assignees be not named in the covenant.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ This is the reason which governed easements, and the very phrase which was used to account for all possessors being bound by a covenant binding a parcel of land to warranty.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Coke says, For such covenant which extends to the support of the thing demised is quodammodo appurtenant to it, and goes with it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Again the language of easements.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And to make this plainer, if need be, it is added, If a man grants to one estovers to repair his house, it is appurtenant to his house.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Estovers for [403] repair went with the land, like other rights of common, /1/ which, as Lord Coke has told us, passed even to disseisors.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the next reign the converse proposition was decided, that an assignee of the reversion was entitled in like manner to the benefit of the covenant, because it is a covenant which runs with the land.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ The same law was applied, with still clearer reason, to a covenant to leave fifteen acres unploughed for pasture, which was held to bind an assignee not named, /3/ and, it would seem, to a covenant to keep land properly manured.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/4/ If the analogy which led to this class of decisions were followed out, a disseisor could sue or be sued upon such covenants, if the other facts were of such a kind as to raise the question.",1,0,0,0,0,0
There is nothing but the novelty of the proposition which need prevent its being accepted.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It has been mentioned above, that words of covenant may annex an easement to land, and that words of grant may import a covenant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It would be rather narrow to give a disseisor one remedy, and deny him another, where the right was one, and the same words made both the grant and the covenant.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/5/ The language commonly used, however, throws doubt and darkness over this and every other question connected with the subject.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is a consequence, already referred to, of confounding covenants for title, and the class last discussed, [404] under the name of covenants running with the land.",0,0,0,0,0,0
According to the general opinion there must be a privity of estate between the covenantor and covenantee in the latter class of cases in order to bind the assigns of the covenantor.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Some have supposed this privity to be tenure; some, an interest of the covenantee in the land of the covenantor; and so on.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ The first notion is false, the second misleading, and the proposition to which they are applied is unfounded.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Privity of estate, as used in connection with covenants at common law, does not mean tenure or easement; it means succession to a title.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ It is never necessary between covenantor and covenantee, or any other persons, except between the present owner and the original covenantee.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"And on principle it is only necessary between them in those cases--such as warranties, and probably covenants for title--where, the covenants being regarded wholly from the side of contract, the benefit goes by way of succession, and not with the land.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If now it should be again asked, at the end of this long discussion, where the line is to be drawn between these two classes of covenants, the answer is necessarily vague in view of the authorities.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The following propositions may be of some service.,0,0,0,0,0,0
With regard to covenants which go with the land:-- *(1.),0,0,0,0,0,0
"Where either by tradition or good sense the burden of the obligation would be said, elliptically, to fall on the land of the covenantor, the creation of such a burden is in theory a grant or transfer of a partial interest in [405] that land to the covenantee.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"As the right of property so created can be asserted against every possessor of the land, it would not be extravagant or absurd to allow it to be asserted by the action of covenant.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Where such a right is granted to the owner of a neighboring piece of land for the benefit of that land, the right will be attached to the land, and go with it into all hands.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The action of covenant would be allowed to assigns not named, and it would not be absurd to give it to disseisors.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"There is one case of a service, the burden of which does not fall upon land even in theory, but the benefit of which might go at common law with land which it benefited.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This is the case of singing and the like by a convent.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It will be observed that the service, although not falling on land, is to be performed by a corporation permanently seated in the neighborhood.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Similar cases are not likely to arise now.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"With regard to covenants which go only with the estate in the land:-- In general the benefit of covenants which cannot be likened to grants, and the burden of which does not fall on land, is confined to the covenantee and those who sustain his persona, namely, his executor or heir.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"In certain cases, of which the original and type was the ancient warranty, and of which the modern covenants for title are present examples, the sphere of succession was enlarged by the mention of assigns, and assigns are still allowed to represent the original covenantee for the purposes of that contract.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it is only by way of succession that any other person than the party to the contract can sue upon it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Hence the plaintiff must always be privy in estate with the covenantee.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[406] C. It is impossible, however, to tell by general reasoning what rights will be held in English law to belong to the former class, or where the line will be drawn between the two.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The authorities must be consulted as an arbitrary fact.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Although it might sometimes seem that the test of the first was whether the service was of a nature capable of grant, so that if it rested purely in covenant it would not follow the land, /1/ yet if this test were accepted, it has already been shown that, apart from tradition, some services which do follow the land could only be matter of covenant.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The grant of light and air, a well- established easement, is called a covenant not to build on the servient land to the injury of the light, by Baron Parke.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/2/ And although this might be doubted, /3/ it has been seen that at least one well-established easement, that of fencing, cannot be considered as a right granted out of the servient land with any more propriety than a hundred other services which would be only matter of contract if the law allowed them to be annexed to land in like manner.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The duty to repair exists only by way of covenant, yet the reasoning of the leading cases is drawn from the law of easement.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"On the other hand, a covenant by a lessee to build a wall upon the leased premises was held, in Spencer's Case, not to bind assigns unless mentioned; /4/ but Lord Coke says that it would have bound them if it had purported to.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The analogy of warranty makes its appearance, and throws a doubt on the fundamental principle of the case.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"We can only say that the application [407] of the law is limited by custom, and by the rule that new and unusual burdens cannot be imposed on land.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The general object of this Lecture is to discover the theory on which a man is allowed to enjoy a special right when the facts out of which the right arises are not true of him.,1,1,1,1,0,0
"The transfer of easements presented itself as one case to be explained, and that has now been analyzed, and its influence on the law has been traced.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the principle of such transfers is clearly anomalous, and does not affect the general doctrine of the law.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The general doctrine is that which has been seen exemplified in prescription, warranty, and such covenants as followed the analogy mentioned Another illustration which has not yet been is to be found in the law of uses.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In old times a use was a chose in action,--that is, was considered very nearly from the point of view of contract, and it had a similar history to that which has been traced in other cases.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"At first it was doubted whether proof of such a secret trust ought to be allowed, even as against the heir.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ It was allowed, however, in the end, /2/ and then the principle of succession was extended to the assign.",0,0,0,0,0,0
But it never went further.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Only those who were privies in estate with the original feoffee to uses, were bound by the use.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A disseisor was no more bound by the confidence reposed in his disseisee, than he was entitled to vouch his disseisee's warrantor.",1,1,0,1,1,0
In the time of Henry VIII.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"it was said that where a use shall be, it is requisite that there be two things, sc.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"confidence, and privity:... as I say, if there be not privity or confidence, [408] then there can be no use: and hence if the feoffees make a feoffment to one who has notice of the use, now the law will adjudge him seised to the first use, since there is sufficient privity between the first feoffor and him, for if he [i.e.",1,1,1,1,1,1
"the first feoflor] had warranted he [the last feoffee] should vouch as assign, which proves privity; and he is in in the per by the feoffees; but where one comes into the land in the post, as the lord by escheat or the disseisor, then the use is altered and changed, because privity is wanting.",1,0,0,0,0,0
/1/ To this day it is said that a trust is annexed in privity to the person and to the estate /2/ (which means to the persona).,1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is not regarded as issuing out of the land like a rent, so that while a rent binds every one who has the land, no matter how, a disseisor is not bound by the trust.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/3/ The case of the lord taking by escheat has been doubted, /4/ and it will be remembered that there is a difference between Bracton and later authors as to whether he comes in as quasi heres or as a stranger.",1,1,1,0,1,0
Then as to the benefit of the use.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"We are told that the right to sue the subpoena descended indeed to the heir, on the ground of heres eadem persona cum antecessore, but that it was not assets.",0,0,0,0,0,0
/5/ The cestui que use was given power to sell by an early statute.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"/6/ But with regard to trusts, Lord Coke tells us that in the reign of Queen Elizabeth [409] all the judges in England held that a trust could not be assigned, because it was a matter in privity between them, and was in the nature of a chose in action.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"/1/ Uses and trusts were both devisable, however, from an early day, /2/ and now trusts are as alienable as any form of property.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The history of early law everywhere shows that the difficulty of transferring a mere right was greatly felt when the situation of fact from which it sprung could not also be transferred.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Analysis shows that the difficulty is real.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The fiction which made such a transfer conceivable has now been explained, and its history has been followed until it has been seen to become a general mode of thought.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It is now a matter of course that the buyer stands in the shoes of the seller, or, in the language of an old law-book, /3/ that the assign is in a manner quasi successor to his assignor.",1,1,1,1,1,1
