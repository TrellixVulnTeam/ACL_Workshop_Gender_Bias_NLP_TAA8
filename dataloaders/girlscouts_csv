That is what I have been asked.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Well, it was this way.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"In the beginning I had used Scouting--that is, wood craft, handiness, and cheery helpfulness--as a means for training young soldiers when they first joined the army, to help them become handy, capable men and able to hold their own with anyone instead of being mere drilled machines._ _You have read about the Wars in your country against the Red Indians, of the gallantry of your soldiers against the cunning of the Red Man, and what is more, of the pluck of your women on those dangerous frontiers._ _Well, we have had much the same sort of thing in South Africa.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Over and over again I have seen there the wonderful bravery and resourcefulness of the women when the tribes of Zulu or Matabeles have been out on the war path against the white settlers._ _In the Boer war a number of women volunteered to help my forces as nurses or otherwise; they were full of pluck and energy, but unfortunately they had never been trained to do anything, and so with all the good-will in the world they were of no use.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"I could not help feeling how splendid it would be if one could only train them in peace time in the same way one trained the young soldiers--that is, through Scoutcraft._ _I afterwards took to training boys in that way, but I had not been long at it before the girls came along, and offered to do the very thing I had hoped for, they wanted to take up Scouting also._ _They did not merely want to be imitators of the boys; they wanted a line of their own._ _So I gave them a smart blue uniform and the names of Guides and my sister wrote an outline of the scheme.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The name Guide appealed to the British girls because the pick of our frontier forces in India is the Corps of Guides.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The term cavalry or infantry hardly describes it since it is composed of all-round handy men ready to take on any job in the campaigning line and do it well._ _Then too, a woman who can be a good and helpful comrade to her brother or husband or son along the path of life is really a guide to him._ _The name Guide therefore just describes the members of our sisterhood who besides being handy and ready for any kind of duty are also a jolly happy family and likely to be good, cheery comrades to their mankind._ _The coming of the Great War gave the Girl Guides their opportunity, and they quickly showed the value of their training by undertaking a variety of duties which made them valuable to their country in her time of need._ _My wife, Lady Baden-Powell, was elected by the members to be the Chief Guide, and under her the movement has gone ahead at an amazing pace, spreading to most foreign countries._ _It is thanks to Mrs Juliette Low, of Savannah, that the movement was successfully started in America, and though the name Girl Scouts has there been used it is all part of the same sisterhood, working to the same ends and living up to the same Laws and Promise._ _If all the branches continue to work together and become better acquainted with each other as they continue to become bigger it will mean not only a grand step for the sisterhood, but what is more important it will be a real help toward making the new League of Nations a living force._ _How can that be?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"In this way:_ _If the women of the different nations are to a large extent members of the same society and therefore in close touch and sympathy with each other, although belonging to different countries, they will make the League a real bond not merely between the Governments, but between the Peoples themselves and they will see to it that it means Peace and that we have no more of War._                                        _Robert Baden Powell._           _May, 1919_ PREFACE The present edition of Scouting for Girls is the result of collaboration on the part of practical workers in the organization from every part of the country.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The endeavor on the part of its compilers has been to combine the minimum of standardization necessary for dignified and efficient procedure, with the maximum of freedom for every local branch in its interpretation and practice of the Girl Scout aims and principles.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Grateful acknowledgments are due to the following: Miss Sarah Louise Arnold, Dean, and Miss Ula M. Dow, A.M., and Dr. Alice Blood, of Simmons College for the Part of Section XI entitled Home Economics; Sir Robert Baden-Powell for frequent references and excerpts from Girl Guiding; Dr. Samuel Lambert for the Part on First Aid, Section XI, and Dr. W.

Power, Miss Mary Davis and Miss Mabel Williams of the New York Public Library, for assistance in the preparation of reference reading for Proficiency Tests, and general reading for Girl Scouts.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It is evident that only a profound conviction of the high aims of the Girl Scout movement and the practical capacity of the organization for realizing them could have induced so many distinguished persons to give so generously of their time and talent to this Handbook.,1,0,0,0,0,0

"She is not satisfied, either, with keeping the letter of the law, when she really breaks it in spirit.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"When she answers you, _she_ means what _you_ mean.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"You can go away and leave her by herself at any time; she does not require any guard but her own sense of honor, which is always to be trusted.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"A Girl Scout Is Loyal= This means that she is true to her Country, to the city or village where she is a citizen, to her family, her church, her school, and to those for whom she may work, or who may work for her.",1,1,0,1,1,0
She is bound to believe the best of them and to defend them if they are slandered or threatened.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Her belief in them may be the very thing they need most, and they must feel that whoever may fail them, a Girl Scout never will.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This does not mean that she thinks her friends and family and school are perfect; far from it.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"But there is a way of standing up for what is dear to you, even though you admit that it has its faults.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"And if you insist on what is best in people, behind their backs, they will be more likely to take your criticism kindly, when you make it to their faces.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"A Girl Scout's Duty Is To Be Useful and to Help Others= This means that if it is a question of being a help to the rest of the world, or a burden on it, a Girl Scout is always to be found among the helpers.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The simplest way of saying this, for very young Scouts, is to tell them to do a GOOD TURN to someone every day they live; that is, to be a _giver_ and not a _taker_.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Some beginners in Scouting, and many strangers, seem to think that any simple act of courtesy, such as we all owe to one another, counts as a good turn, or that one's mere duty to one's parents is worthy of Scout notice.",0,0,0,0,0,0

B. SEMAPHORE SIGNALLING SEMAPHORE CODE The semaphore is a machine with two arms which may be moved into various positions to make letters.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The semaphore code shown in the accompanying picture may also be employed by a person using two flags.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is the quickest method of flag signalling but is available for comparatively short distances, seldom over a mile, unless extra large flags are employed or there is some extraordinary condition of background or atmosphere.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"The regulation flag is 18 inches square, either divided diagonally into two triangles of white and red, or square of white with small square of red in the center, or red with small square of white.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These flags are fastened on poles 24 inches long and 1/2 inch in diameter.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The flags must be carefully held so that the sticks make, as it were, a continuation of the arm bone; a bent wrist will cause the flags to make an entirely different angle, and consequently a different letter from the one intended.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Swing the arms smoothly and without hesitation from one letter to another.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Hold each letter long enough to make it clear to the person receiving it.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"The six following subjects, Home Economics, Child Care, First Aid, Home Nursing, Public Health, and Personal Health are grouped together, and for proficiency in all of them a special badge called Scout Aide is awarded.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This badge will probably be regarded by the outside world as the most important decoration the Girl Scouts can win, and all Scouts who will try for it should realize that those who wear it will represent the organization in a very special sense and will be eager to prove their practical knowledge and ability in the important subjects it stands for.",1,0,0,0,0,0
No young child could pretend to represent ALL this medal stands for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Any grown girl or woman should be proud to own it.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Practical knowledge of Personal Health, Public Health and Child Care will add to the efficiency and happiness of this nation, and the women of today have a better chance to control these things than ever before.",0,0,0,0,0,0

THE HOME MAKER BY SARAH LOUISE ARNOLD Formerly Dean of Simmons College _The Keeper of the House._ Every Girl Scout knows that good homes make a country great and good; so every woman wants to understand home-making.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course that means keeping a house; and of course that means that Girl Scouts should try for the Housekeeper Merit Badge, the Home Maker.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now making a home doesn't mean just having it, owning it and holding its key.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It means making it a good place to live in, or helping to make it so.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This sounds like the House that Jack built; but all this belongs to the making of a home.,0,0,0,0,0,0
_Planning Your House._ When you plan a house of your own you must think what it needs most.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"You would choose, first of all, to have abundant air, fresh and clean; a dry spot where dampness will not stay; sunshine at some time of day in every room of the house, which you can have if your house faces southeast; and you must be able to get a good supply of pure water.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You will want to make your house warm in the winter and cool in the summer, so you will look out for windows, doors and porches.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Think what must be done in a house: eating, sleeping, working, resting, by the whole family.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How many rooms must you have?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Draw a plan of some house in your neighborhood that seems good to live in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Make up your mind what you like best in that house.,1,0,0,0,0,0
_Furnishings._ Then houses must be furnished with the things that the family needs.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The furniture will be for use.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You must ask every piece what it is good for.,1,0,0,0,0,0
What will you do with it?,1,0,0,0,0,0
Could you get along without it?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Some things you would use constantly, others once in a while.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Which would you get first if you were planning carefully?,1,0,0,0,0,0
"How much would it cost to furnish the house for which you have drawn the plans: to furnish the kitchen, the living room, the bedrooms?",0,0,0,0,0,0
Make a list of the furniture _needed_ (not just _wanted_) for each room with the cost of each piece.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It is worth while for you to go to look at furniture in stores and to think about buying it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Then you will discover that a piece of furniture that looks well in the store might not look at all well in your house, for furniture must suit the house and the room into which it goes.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It must fit, we say.",1,0,0,0,0,0
No other furniture will do.,0,0,0,0,0,0
So the Girl Scout will make up her mind what will fit her house; and of course this means also what will fit the family purse.,1,1,1,1,1,1
For the keeper of the house must not let into her house one single thing that she cannot afford to buy.,1,0,0,0,0,0
She will take pride in that.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"So when you make a list of furniture--with its price--make sure that everything you choose, suits, or fits, _your_ house.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"_The Cellar._ Most houses are built over cellars, for purposes of sanitation, heating and water supply, as well as for storage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The Girl Scout who lives in the country probably knows all about cellars for they are much needed there.,1,0,0,0,0,0
The city girl may live in an apartment and may never think of a cellar.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Look at the cellars of two or three houses.,0,0,0,0,0,0
How are they built?,0,0,0,0,0,0
Did you plan for one in your house?,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The cellar should be well ventilated, having light as well as air.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Its windows should be screened; the floor should be dry and if possible made of cement; the walls should be whitewashed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Ashes should be kept in a galvanized iron barrel, to prevent fire.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"A cellar should be a clean place, corners and all.",0,0,0,0,0,0
_The Kitchen._ The kitchen is a work-shop; it should be sunny and airy.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Look out for windows to let in the fresh air and sunshine.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"And while you are thinking of windows, be sure that they can open at the top and bottom to let sweetness in, and drive bad odors out.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your kitchen should hold things that are necessary, and nothing else.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"It should be easy to keep clean, having painted walls, and the floor should be of hard pine or else covered with linoleum.",0,0,0,0,0,0
When a Girl Scout takes care of the kitchen she is in honor bound to keep all the corners clean and to leave no dust nor crumbs of food anywhere about.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She will take great pains to keep flies out of the kitchen and so will have her windows screened.,1,1,0,1,1,0
"A good kitchen is provided with a sink and if possible with running water; and it must have a good stove, with a place for keeping wood or coal if either is used.",1,0,0,0,0,0
_The Kitchen Floor._ The floor of the kitchen should be made of hard wood.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Maple or hard pine will make a good floor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A hard-wood floor can be dressed with shellac or with oil.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The wood absorbs this dressing so that water will not soak in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
A floor which has been shellacked should be wiped with warm water.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Not much water will be needed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The oiled floor can be wiped and dried, then oiled lightly from time to time.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Linoleum or oilcloth may be used to cover an old floor.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If the floor is rough it should be made even by planing before the linoleum is put down, and the cracks should be filled.",1,0,0,0,0,0
If you can't get linoleum you can paint your floor with a hard floor paint.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Be sure to get a paint that dries hard.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The linoleum should be frequently washed with warm water and soap and then rinsed carefully before it is dried.,1,0,0,0,0,0
_The Kitchen Stove._ The chief business of the kitchen stove is to provide heat for cooking.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It must hold a fire, and so must be made of something which will not burn.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Stoves are usually made of iron.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Fire will not burn without air, so a place must be arranged to let air into the stove, and just enough to make the fire burn clearly and furnish the right amount of heat.",0,0,0,0,0,0
That is what the front dampers or slides are for.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The fuel, wood or coal, is held in the fire-box.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The heated air makes the top of the stove hot for frying, broiling or boiling, and the oven hot for baking.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The smoke and gases from the fire must not come out into the room to blind our eyes or suffocate us; the chimney is built to take care of the smoke and gases, and there must be a way for them to get into the chimney; the stove pipe is for this.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But the game you have to play with your stove is to let the smoke and gases run up chimney, but to save all the heat you can for the work to be done.",0,0,0,0,0,0
So your stove is supplied with dampers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"When the fire is new, and there is much smoke or gas, you open the damper into the stovepipe, and in the stovepipe.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Try to get a picture of the way the heated air goes from the fire-box up into the chimney.,0,0,0,0,0,0
We call this direct draft.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Of course a great deal of heat runs away through the chimney, and so your fuel is wasted.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now if you want to save heat, and particularly if you want to bake, and must have a hot oven, you will close the oven damper that has made the short easy way into the stovepipe.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Then the heated air must find another way to get to the chimney, and it has to go around the oven to do this.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"While the hot air is finding its way around the oven, it heats it, ready for your baking.",1,0,0,0,0,0
We call this the indirect draft.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Look over your kitchen stove and see how this happens.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Take off the covers, open every door, and examine every part.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Stoves must be carefully managed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The fires must burn readily and the cooking must be done with the least possible amount of wood or coal.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This means a clean stove, free from ashes and with a clear draft.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Wood or coal will burn freely in the air.,0,0,0,0,0,0
They will stop burning if there is no draft.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Learn to manage your draft.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Remember that stoves are made with a damper, in order to control the current of hot air.",0,0,0,0,0,0
If the oven damper is closed this heated air _must_ pass over and around the oven before it gets to the chimney and so heat the oven.,1,0,0,0,0,0
If it is open the hot air can immediately escape up the chimney.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When starting the fire leave the damper open.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"As soon as it is burning well, close it so that the oven will be heated.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Your stove should also have a damper in the pipe, to save the heat which would otherwise run up the chimney.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If there is none, have one put in.",0,0,0,0,0,0
There are also dampers or slides in front of the stove to control the amount of air going in.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The housekeeper must learn how to manage her stove; she must get acquainted with it, for every stove has its own way.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Draw a picture or plan of the stove that you know best.,0,0,0,0,0,0
See if you can tell plainly how to build a fire in your stove.,0,0,0,0,0,0
If you use natural gas or a kerosene stove tell how that should be managed.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"_Gas and Oil Stoves._ Cooking may be done on an iron stove with either coal or wood as fuel, or the stove may be planned for burning gas or kerosene.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The coal fire must be fed several times a day with coal and the ashes must be removed to keep the fire burning clearly.,1,0,0,0,0,0
Wood burns out quickly and must be replaced often.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Both wood and coal stoves mean almost constant care for the housekeeper.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Gas gives less trouble.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It comes in pipes from outside the house.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This means that somebody else--the gas company--provides the supply.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You turn on the gas when you want to use it and turn it off, if you are wise and thoughtful, the moment it is not needed.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The gas company measures the amount of gas that you use by its meter, and you pay for every bit that you burn or waste.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The important thing, then, is to use as little gas as possible in order to pay for as little as possible.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You would rather pay twenty-five cents for a thrift stamp, than for gas that had burned simply because you had forgotten to turn it off.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Be sure that gas is turned completely off at all places and never have a low light burning, as the flame may be blown out and the unburned gas escape.",0,0,0,0,0,0
This would be dangerous and might even kill persons in the house.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The kerosene stove may be used instead of a gas stove in houses which are not piped for a gas supply.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If wicks are used they must be carefully trimmed, so that they will be clean and even.",1,0,0,0,0,0
A kerosene stove needs frequent cleaning.,0,0,0,0,0,0
It should be kept free from dust and from drippings of oil.,0,0,0,0,0,0
The Fireless Cooker When a Girl Scout gets to thinking about all the work to be done in a kitchen she will ask some very important questions.,1,1,1,1,1,1
How much work is to be done?,1,1,1,1,1,1
How long does it take to do it?,1,1,1,1,1,1
Can time be saved by doing it in a better way?,0,0,0,0,0,0
How can I save labor?,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The Girl Scout will find the answers one at a time, if she does her own work.",1,1,0,1,1,0
And if you do your own work you will at once call for a fireless cooker.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The name sounds impossible, for you have always cooked with a stove, and, of course, a fire.",0,0,0,0,0,0
How can you cook without a fire?,0,0,0,0,0,0
The women of Norway taught us how.,0,0,0,0,0,0
When they went out to work in the fields or on the farm they took the hot kettle of soup off the stove and hid it away in a hay box.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"The hay kept the heat in the kettle instead of letting it escape; so the soup kept on cooking, and when the women came home from their work in the fields there it was, all steaming hot and ready for dinner.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Everyone has noticed how some things carry or conduct heat and other things don't.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"That's why we use a holder, when handling a hot dish or stove lifter or tea-pot.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The holder does not carry the heat to the hand; it keeps it away.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"So the hay packed around the hot kettle kept the heat in the kettle, refusing to conduct it away.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Therefore the soup went on cooking.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Your English cousins use a cosy to cover the hot teapot or coffee pot.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This cosy is made of quilted cotton; and looks like the quilted hood that your great-grandmother used to have.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This keeps the heat in the tea or coffee, so that you can have a second cup for the asking.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"America was slow to learn from her thrifty cousins, but at last she adopted the fireless cooker; and this is what it does: The fireless cooker, a case packed with some material which refuses to conduct heat, is used to continue the cooking of foods after they have been made hot on the stove.",1,0,0,0,0,0
When securely covered in the cooker they will go on cooking for several hours because the heat is retained by the protecting case.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A Girl Scout may buy a fireless cooker, paying from $5 to $25 for it, or she may make one, which will cost less than one dollar.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Of course this is a challenge to make one.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You may be very sure that if you make a fireless cooker you will understand all about it.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"To make a fireless cooker you will need: (1) _A cooker or container_, which should be an agate pail with a close fitting cover.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The sides should be straight up and down, the bottom just as big as the top.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You can choose a small one holding two quarts, or a gallon pail which would be large enough for anything an ordinary family would be likely to cook.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"(2) _A case_, which must be at least eight inches wider than your container, for the packing must extend at least four inches around the pail on every side.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"You may use a round case like a big wooden candy pail, which you can usually get at the ten cent store for ten cents; or it may be a galvanized iron can with a cover like the one ordinarily used for garbage; or it may be a box shaped like a cube.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"(3) For packing you may use crumpled newspapers tightly packed in; or ground cork, which is used in packing Malaga grapes, is fine, and you may be able to get it from a fruit store.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Excelsior is good, and perhaps you will find that in the shed in some packing case; while, if you live in the country, you may be able to get Spanish moss.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This should be dried, of course.",0,0,0,0,0,0
And then there is hay--which our Norwegian cousins use.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Let us try paper.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Pack the box or can four inches deep, with crumpled paper, making a very even layer.",0,0,0,0,0,0

"THE FIRST AIDE IN ACCIDENTS AND EMERGENCIES General Rules The sorrow and unhappiness of the world is increased enormously every year by injury and loss from accidents, more than half of which might be prevented if someone had not been careless, or if someone else had taken a little trouble to correct the results of that carelessness before they caused an accident.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"_Carelessness in the Street._ As, for example, taking chances in getting across in front of a car or automobile; running from behind a car without looking to see of some vehicle is coming from another direction; catching a ride by hanging on to the rear end of cars or wagons; getting off cars before they stop; getting on or off cars in the wrong way; being too interested to watch for open manholes, cellarways, sewers, etc.",0,0,0,0,0,0

A tourniquet is something put on to make pressure on a blood vessel to stop serious bleeding.,0,0,0,0,0,0
There are five points to remember about a tourniquet: 1.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It must be long enough to tie around the limb--a big handkerchief, towel or wide bandage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"There must be a pad to make the pressure over the artery greater than on the rest of the limb--a smooth stone, a darning ball, a large cork, cloth folded into a large pad or a rolled bandage.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"The pad must be so placed that the artery lies between pad and the bone on the limb, in order that the pressure may stop the flow of blood by forcing the walls of the artery together between the pad and the bone.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Unless the tourniquet is put on tight enough, its application increases bleeding.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It is extremely rare to find a tourniquet put on tight enough.,0,0,0,0,0,0
In almost every such case removing the tourniquet will stop or partly lessen bleeding.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"A short stick or handle is needed, about a foot long, with which to twist the tourniquet sufficiently to stop the flow of blood.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Usually it cannot be twisted tightly enough by hand alone.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Tie the twisted part firmly so it will not slip, after it has been made tight enough to stop bleeding.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Remember, a tourniquet stops most of the circulation below it as well as in the cut artery, and must not be left in place too long for fear of injury to the rest of the limb by cutting off the circulation.",1,0,0,0,0,0
_Usually it should not be left on for more than an hour._ _Bleeding from Veins_--Bleeding from the veins is not so dangerous as from an artery.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"The blood from the heart has to go through the little capillaries before it gets into the veins, and therefore the force of the heart muscle on the blood in the veins is not so great as in the arteries.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"You have already learned what to do to stop the bleeding from the smaller veins, and that it is not serious.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"From the larger veins, however, it can be very serious, and it may be necessary for you to put on a tourniquet before the doctor arrives in order to save the patient's life.",0,0,0,0,0,0
Almost always bleeding from a vein can be controlled by clean gauze or handkerchief pad and pressure by hand directly over the bleeding wound.,0,0,0,0,0,0

"If necessary, it is wisest to apply them in the same way as for arterial hemorrhage and stop the circulation in the whole limb.",0,0,0,0,0,0
It is important to know in a general way where the blood vessels are in order to put the pad over them to stop the bleeding.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Roughly speaking, the artery of the arm runs down about in a line with the inner seam of the coat.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The artery and vein of the leg run about in a line with the inside seam of a man's trousers.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"_Stimulants_--In serious bleeding of any kind do not give stimulants until the bleeding has been stopped, as the stimulants increase the force of the heart and so increase the flow of blood.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"RESCUE [Illustration] When a person gives up the struggle in the water, the body goes down, and then because of its buoyancy it comes to the surface and some air is expelled from the lungs, making the body less buoyant.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"It immediately sinks again, this time a little lower, and again comes to the surface, and more air is expelled.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This process may be repeated several times, until sufficient water is taken into the stomach and lungs to overcome the buoyancy of the body and it no longer appears at the surface; but the buoyancy is barely overcome, and therefore the body will float easily.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This can easily be utilized in saving the drowning person by making the water carry most of the weight of the body.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ability to carry and lift or move is not so much dependent upon absolute strength as it is on knowing how.,0,0,0,0,0,0

SECTION XII SETTING-UP EXERCISES FOR GIRL SCOUTS Our bodies are like machines that need frequent oiling and testing to see that all parts are working right.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Or they are like instruments that must be tuned before they are played.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"If this is not done, the machinery gets rusty and clogged, or the instrument gets out of tune and makes horrid noises.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"That is the way it is with our bodies; our muscles and joints should be bent and stretched every day to take the kinks out, and keep them strong and flexible.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"The best way is to tune up every morning for just a few minutes before you put on your clothes, and then again at night to rest the tired parts and exercise the parts that have not been used, so you can even things up.",0,0,0,0,0,0
=The Right Position= First of all try to stand in the right position.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"[Illustration] Stand with the feet side by side, a few inches apart and pointed straight ahead.",0,0,0,0,0,0

This is not natural.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"If you stand on a step with one foot even with the edge, and let the other foot hang over the step below, it will hang parallel with the foot you are standing on.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"That is the way it is meant to go, and people who turn out their toes do so much walking sideways that they have to travel much farther than if they kept their feet pointed in the direction they want to go.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"[Illustration] Then your legs should come up straight from your ankles; don't stand either on your heels or your toes, but right over the highest part of the arch, which is the strongest part, and best fitted to bear your weight when you are standing still, and brings your hips up to just the right place to hold your body.",1,0,0,0,0,0
*       *       *       *       * In the lower part of your body are some big heavy bones shaped somewhat like a bowl.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"This bowl is balanced on the top of your legs, and holds most of your organs.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If this bowl is balanced just right, the organs remain in place, the way they are meant to be, but if it is not balanced right, the contents are tipped so that they would come tumbling out if the muscles intended for other work did not hold them in.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is hard on these muscles which have their own work to do, and if they are used to hold up things that should keep their own balance, sooner or later they give way, and there is a sad accident, or a general slump.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Then instead of saying, That foolish person always stood in the wrong position and of course her insides got out of place, we say, Poor dear so-and-so has given out from overwork and has acute indigestion, or a 'floating kidney,' or 'a bad liver.'",0,0,0,0,0,0

_Don't arch your chest and throw your shoulders back!_ This is not a slump and does not mean to let your back bow out.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"If your shoulders are easy you can straighten your back and your head will balance itself, and there you are: a straight upstanding Scout, ready for what comes next.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Remember: a) Feet pointing straight ahead.,0,0,0,0,0,0
b) Body balanced on legs coming up straight from           ankles.,0,0,0,0,0,0
c) Shoulders easy under ears.,0,0,0,0,0,0
This gives a straight line from top of head through shoulders and hips to between ankles.,0,0,0,0,0,0

Seeds The principal counsel to be given here is to use great care in the selection of seeds because it is a bitter disappointment and a discouraging experience to find that after all your labor your seeds are worthless.,0,0,0,0,0,0

The rest of the bed devote to string or butter beans.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"You will have left for these a space of eighty-eight inches, or a little more than seven feet.",0,0,0,0,0,0
The rows of beans must be farther apart than the other vegetables you have planted.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Two feet between the rows is not too much.,0,0,0,0,0,0
You will have space enough for three rows.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Measure from your last row of beets one foot six inches at each side of your bed.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Now stretch your line across your bed at this distance from the beets, then with a hoe make a furrow close to the line.",1,0,0,0,0,0
This furrow should be two inches deep at least.,0,0,0,0,0,0

You should now have left a space of eighteen inches between your last furrow and the end of the bed.,1,0,0,0,0,0
"Into these three furrows place the beans, spacing them.",1,0,0,0,0,0

"Soon the delicate shoots will begin to appear above the ground, and with them will also appear the shoots of many weeds whose seeds were in the soil.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These weeds constitute a call to your next operation which is Cultivation Declare war on the weeds.,1,0,0,0,0,0

A Bowline is used chiefly for hoisting and lowering; it can be used for a halter or with the Sheet-bend in making a guard-line or fence.,1,0,0,0,0,0
It is a knot holding fast a loop which can be made of any size and which will not jam or give.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"To make a Bowline-knot: Take the end in the right hand; Draw the rope toward you over the palm of the left hand, measuring off as much as is needed to make the required size loop; Drop the end; Make a small bight in the palm of the left hand by turning the rope toward the ends of the fingers; Take the end in the right hand; Pass it up through the bight; Back of and around the standing part; Down through the bight; Pull the end and the rope forming the loop against the standing part.",1,0,0,0,0,0

INTRODUCTION A girl must be a Second Class Scout before receiving a Merit Badge in any subject.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"However, this does not mean that she cannot begin to study her subject and plan for passing the test at any time.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"Proficiency in these tests is to be determined by the Local Council, or by persons competent (in the opinion of the Council) to judge it.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"If no Local Council exists, certificates should be secured from persons competent to judge each subject, such as teachers of music, dancing or drawing, riding masters, motorists, electricians, milliners, dressmakers, artists, craftsmen, scientists and so forth.",0,0,0,0,0,0
These certificates should be sent to the National Headquarters or to the nearest District Headquarters for inspection.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Headquarters will either pass on these, or indicate the nearest local body competent to deal with them.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The tests as given are topical outlines of what a Scout should know about the subject rather than formal questions.,0,0,0,0,0,0
Captains and others giving the tests will adapt the wording to the needs of the particular case.,0,0,0,0,0,0
With many subjects a list of standard references is given.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"It is desirable that a girl should read at least one of these books, not in order to pass an examination but that she may be familiar with the general field and the great names and principles associated with it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Where a whole troop is working on a subject, portions of the books may be read at troop meetings, or several Scouts can read together and discuss their impressions.",1,0,0,0,0,0
It is important that every Girl Scout should understand that the winning of any one of the following Merit Badges does not mean that she is a finished expert in the subject.,1,1,1,1,0,0
What does it mean then?,1,1,1,1,0,0
It means three things:           1.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She has an intelligent interest in the subject           2.,0,0,0,0,0,0
She has a reasonable knowledge of its broad           principles           3.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"She is able to present some practicable proofs           of her knowledge, so that a competent examiner can           see that she has not simply crammed it up from a           book.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Doing, not talking or writing is the           principle of the Girl Scouts One of the great things about these Merit Badges is that they require a definite amount of perseverance.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"This is a quality in which women are sometimes said to be lacking; if this is a fair criticism, the Merit Badges will certainly test it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
Nobody compels any Scout to earn these Badges; she deliberately chooses to do so.,1,1,1,1,1,1
"Therefore, to fail in a task she has voluntarily set herself, comes straight back to her and shows her what stuff she is made of.",1,1,0,1,1,0
"For while it is of no particular importance how many things you start in this life, it is of great importance how many things you finish!",0,0,0,0,0,0
"Out OF GOODNESS of heart, or quick interest, or sudden resolution, a girl will start out to master a subject, earn a certain sum of money, make something for herself or someone else, form some good habit or break some bad one; and after her first enthusiasm has died out, where is she?",1,1,1,1,0,0
So that a great many people laugh at a girl's plans--and with reason.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"Now while this may be merely amusing, so long as it affects only the girl herself, it becomes very annoying when other people's affairs are involved, and may be positively dangerous if carried too far.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"If your life depended upon a Girl Scout's efforts to resuscitate you from drowning, you would be very glad if she stuck to it.",1,0,0,0,0,0
"But if she happened to be a girl who had started to win five different Merit Badges, and had given them all up, half way through, what sort of chance do you think you would have?",1,0,0,0,0,0
"Girl Scouts are slower to begin than other girls, perhaps, but they stick to it till they've made good.",1,0,0,0,0,0
She carried that through like a Girl Scout ought to become a common saying.,0,0,0,0,0,0
"PROFICIENCY TESTS ARTIST SYMBOL--A PALETTE [Illustration] Submit a drawing, a painting, or a model of sculpture which in the judgment of a competent professional represents a sufficiently high order of ability to merit recognition.",0,0,0,0,0,0
"This badge is offered with the object of           encouraging a talent already existing, and it is           not suggested that Girl Scouts should select this           badge unless they are possessed of sufficient           natural talent to warrant presenting their work to           a good judge.",1,0,0,0,0,0
The standard required for winning           the badge is left to the judgment of the           professional as it is impossible for the           organization to lay down strict requirements in           these subjects.,1,0,0,0,0,0
